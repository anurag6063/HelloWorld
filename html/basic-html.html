<!-- Document Type: it was introduced just to maintain backward compatability 

    Person person = new Person();
    or Html html = new Html();
        Its like calling out the type;
        Here we define Person's defination, but it html its common and its already described by w3 org

    person.head();
    person.body();
    or
    html.body();
    html.head()
        person has 2 inportant functions;  
        html encloses body and head; just like a person has head and body.
        head tells about main features of the person and to communicate with head we need to first know which language the html person understands.
        so <html||person lang="en" >
            this is also used by screen readers / dispaly the exact laguage and make modifications if needed accordingly.

        span and divs are used to group data so that we can apply CSS on it.
        I am grouped but you still cant see me.
