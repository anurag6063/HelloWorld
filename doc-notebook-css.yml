Notes:  
  - note: CSS stands for cascading style sheet. 
    comment: to cascade means pass or arrange sequentially. It's generally different sheet. 
      There like properties in springboot. 

  - note: general rule
    comment: > 
     SELECTOR { KEY: VALUE }r h1 { size: 19} 
     ,sequentially.

  - note: different ways to add style
    comment: > 
      a) in HTML element directly , h1 {style= "color=red"},
      b) in head using style tag, <head> <style type="css/text"> h1 {color: red} </style></head>
      c) in a stylesheet. Best is in a different sheet. But in element class overrides others. 
         <link href="./lib/my.css">

  - note: color coding
    comment: > 
      a) heaxadeciimal no -> #intesite-of-red-green-blue
      b) rgb() -> 3 nos varing from 0 to 255
      c) rgba() -> 3 nos for rgb and 0 to 1 for transperancy factor. 

  - note: background
    comment: we can set either an image of a color. using background\ \[URL\]; or  background-repete [URL] or color code
       
  - note: border
    comment: has 3 components; width, color and style -> border { WIDTH STYLE COLOR} { 2px dashed blue}

  - note: element selector
    comment: < 
      a) simple- ELEMENT name  like hq, body ; needs no additonal Chapter
      b) Id - needs hash at start ; Id can be just one per page.
      c) Class - used as .CLASSNAME {} 
      d) combinations - is generally more specific h1 first-n

  - note: specificity
    comment: Why - because its cascaded style, parents syle affects all its children till they overwrite it.
      we can online specificity calculator this no tell which style will finally run an a elemnt, in CSS 
      debug console if child overrides parents style the parent style can be seen as strikedthrough.
      to specific something on all elements we can say *{}; 

  - note: fonts
    comment: font-family; font-size -> in pixel thats absolute or in em that's relative to base size, while using
      em bettter alter base size of the whole bosy first. font-weight; is for how bold. we have fonts in 
      google fonts, insert the link and class from there to use. 

  - note: text 
    comment: >
      a) text-aling - left right, center, float 
      b) text decorate - highlight, strikethrough etc
