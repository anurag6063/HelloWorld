Notes: 
  - note: jq events
    comment:  click, keypress and on() methods can do it.
  - note: jq objects 
    comment: jqObjects gets created when we call $([something]); same goes for this keyword,\
      in jq its $(this)/
  - note: types of keypress
    comment: keyup() - when key is comes up, keydown()- when key is pressed down,
     keypress() - generally fires at midpoint between up and down, this is best one and generally used. \
     it gives exact character pressed, since character can change when pressed with special keys like shift.

  - note: all the above events, click, keypress() etc plus others can be captured in on()
    comment: this takes on(["type of call"], function(){})'; use this inside its function so that its pin pointed
      and not all the objects of that type get affected.

  - note: event keyword
    comment: in function() the first param that comes in is an event object from JS library, as in JAVA the type always stands \
      as event so here we can name the object event as anything, like in java -> Event e ; Event ev ; Event event
      as in jave we have standard to name the object as the Type if we can we use event name
      
  - name: difference b/w on and click/keypress
    comment: on() can add event listner on elements that have not been rendered unlike others. the first element whould be the one that really exists when the page is rendered.

  - name: fading effects
    comment: we can fade in, out or toggle. better use toggle, toggle class and the effect happens.

  - name: slide up/down/toggle 
    comment: they can pull an element from down to up, up to down and do revers of current state respectively.
