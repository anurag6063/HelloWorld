Octal QSGMII to 10/100/1000Base-T or Fiber 
Transceiver

GENERAL DESCRIPTION FEATURES

The BCM50685 transceiver can support either eight 
QSGMII to copper (10/100/1000Base-T) or eight 
QSGMII to Fiber (100Base-FX, 1000Base-X, or SGMII-
Slave) interfaces. When in QSGMII to Copper mode 
the PHY performs all of the physical layer (PHY) 
functions for 1000Base-T, 100Base-TX, and 10Base-T 
on standard Category 5 UTP cable. When in QSGMII 
to Fiber mode the PHY performs all of the physical 
layer (PHY) functions for 100Base-FX, 1000Base-X 
and SGMII-Slave. The BCM50685 is designed to 
comply with the QSGMII industry standard and to 
exceed IEEE specifications for noise cancellation and 
transmission jitter, providing consistent and reliable 
operation over the broadest range of existing cable 
plants.

The BCM50685 is based on the proven digital-signal 
processor technology of Broadcom®, combining 
digital adaptive equalizers, ADCs, phase locked loops, 
line drivers, encoders, decoders, echo cancelers, 
crosstalk cancelers, and all other required support 
circuitry integrated into a single monolithic CMOS 
chip.

Designed for reliable operation over worst-case 
Category 5 cable plants, the BCM50685 
automatically negotiates with any transceiver on the 
opposite end of the wire to agree on an operating 
speed. The PHY can also evaluate the condition of the 
twisted-pair wiring to ensure that the wiring can 
support operation at Gigabit speeds, and detect and 
correct most common wiring problems. The device 
continually monitors both the wiring and the 
opposing transceiver and alerts the system if it 
detects potential problems with reliable operation.

• Support for the following copper line interfaces:
– 1000Base-T
– 100Base-TX
– 10Base-T

• Support for the following Fiber line interfaces:
– 100Base-FX
– 1000Base-X
– SGMII-Slave

• Integrated Twisted Pair termination resistors

• Support for only two power supplies (1.2V and 

3.3V)
• Line-Side and Switch-Side loopback
• Ethernet@WireSpeed™
• Cable plant diagnostics that detects cable plant 

impairments
• Programmable LEDs
• Robust Cable ESD (CESD) tolerance 
• Low EMI emissions
• IEEE 1149.1 and 1149.6 (ACJTAG) boundary scan
• Package: 23 mm x  23 mm 484-pin PBGA

Serial Gigabit Media Independent InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface
The BCM50685 can communicate with Ethernet devices that support Serial Gigabit Media Independent 
Interface (SGMII). The SGMII transmits serial data differentially at 1.25 gbaud via the SGOUT± pins, and 
receives serial data differentially via the SGIN± pins, which includes an on-chip, 100Ω differential termination 
resistor. In SGMII mode, serial output data is clocked on both edges of a differential 625 MHz clock via the 
SGIN± pins. Because the BCM50685 provides clock recovery on the SGMII input data, the input clock is not 
required.

Quad Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface
The BCM50685 can communicate with Ethernet MAC or Switch devices that support Quad Serial Gigabit Media 
Independent Interface (QSGMII). The QSGMII transmits serial data differentially at 5 gbaud via the QSGOUT± 
pins, and receives 5 gbaud serial data differentially via the QSGIN± pins, which includes an on-chip, 100Ω 
differential termination resistor. 

The BCM50685 supports two QSGMII ports. Each QSGMII port supports four PHYs.

Management Interface 
The BCM50685 contains a large set of management registers. The Status and control registers of the 
BCM50685 are accessible through the MDIO and MDC serial interface. The functional and electrical interface 
complies with IEEE Std 802.3, Section 22, and also supports MDC clock rates of up to 12.5 MHz. The 
management interface supports the defined Status and Control registers of IEEE Std 802.3, Clauses 22, 28, 37, 
and 40. In addition, the BCM50685 contains multipurpose registers for extended software control.

Encoder 
In 10Base-T mode, Manchester encoding is performed on the data stream that is transmitted on the twisted-
pair cable. The multimode transmit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) performs preequalization for 100m of 
Category 3 cabling.

In 100Base-TX mode, the BCM50685 transmits a continuous data stream over the twisted-pair cable. The 
transmit packet is encapsulated by replacing the first 2 nibbles of preamble with a start-of-stream delimiter (/
J/K codes) and appending an end-of-stream delimiter (/T/R codes) to the end of the packet. The transmitter 
repeatedly sends the idle code group between packets. The encoded data stream is serialized and then 
scrambled by the stream cipher block, as described in “Stream Cipher” on page 35. The scrambled data is then 
encoded into MLT3 signal levels.

DecoderBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

In 1000Base-T mode, the BCM50685 simultaneously transmits and receives a continuous data stream on all 
four pairs of the Category 5 cable. Byte-wide data from the transmit data pins is scrambled when the transmit 
enable is asserted, and the trellis (a PAM5 symbol on each of the four twisted-pairs) is encoded into a four-
dimensional code group and then inserted into the transmit data stream. The transmit packet is encapsulated 
by replacing the first two bytes of the preamble with a start-of-stream delimiter, and appending an end-of-
stream delimiter to the end of the packet. When the transmit error input is asserted during a packet 
transmission, a transmit error code group is sent in place of the corresponding data code group. The 
transmitter sends idle code groups or carrier extend code groups between packets. Carrier extension is used 
by the Switch to separate packets within a multiple-packet burst, and is indicated by asserting the transmit 
error signal and placing 0Fh on the transmit data pins while the transmit enable is low. A carrier extend error 
is indicated by replacing the transmit data input with 1Fh during carrier extension.

The encoding complies with IEEE 802.3ab and is fully compatible with previous versions of the Broadcom 
1000Base-T PHYs.

Decoder 
In 10Base-T mode, Manchester decoding is performed on the data stream.

In 100Base-TX mode, following equalization and clock recovery, the receive data stream is converted from 
MLT3 to serial non-return to zero (NRZ) data. The NRZ data is descrambled by the stream cipher block, as 
described later in this document. The descrambled data is then deserialized and aligned into 5-bit code groups. 
The 5-bit code groups are decoded into 4-bit data nibbles. The start-of-stream delimiter is replaced with 
preamble nibbles, and the end-of-stream delimiter and idle codes are replaced with 0h. The decoded data is 
driven onto the MII receive data pins. When an invalid code group is detected in the data stream, the 
BCM50685 asserts the MII receive error (RX_ER) signal. RX_ER is also asserted when the link fails or when the 
descrambler loses lock during packet reception.

In 1000Base-T mode, the receive data stream is:

• Passed through the 
Viterbi decoder

Link MonitorBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Link Monitor
In 10Base-T mode, a link-pulse detection circuit constantly monitors the TRD[0]{8:1}± and TRD[1]{8:1}± pins for 
the presence of valid link pulses.

In 100Base-TX mode, receive signal energy is detected by monitoring the receive pair for transitions in the 
signal level. Signal levels are qualified using squelch detect circuits. When no signal is detected on the receive 
pair, the link monitor enters the Link Fail state, and the transmission and reception of data packets are disabled. 
When a valid signal is detected on the receive pair for a minimum of 1 ms, the link monitor enters the Link Pass 
state, and the transmit and receive functions are enabled.

Following auto-negotiation in 1000Base-T mode, the master transceiver begins sending data on the media. The 
slave transceiver also begins transmitting when it has recovered the master transceiver’s timing. Each end of 
the link continuously monitors its local receiver status. When the local receiver status has been good for at least 
1 μs, the link monitor enters the Link Pass state, and the transmission and reception of data packets are 
enabled. When the local receiver status is bad for more than 750 ms, the link monitor enters the Link Fail state, 
and the transmission and reception of data packets are then disabled.

Digital Adaptive Equalizer
The digital adaptive equalizer removes intersymbol interference (ISI) created by the transmission channel 
media. The equalizer accepts sampled unequalized data from the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on each 
channel and produces equalized data. The BCM50685 achieves an optimum signal-to-noise ratio by using a 
combination of feed forward equalization (FFE) and decision feedback equalization (DFE) techniques. Under 
harsh noise environments, these powerful techniques achieve a bit error rate (BER) of less than 1 x 10-12 for 
transmissions of: up to 100m on Category 5 twisted-pair cabling for 1000Base-T and 100Base-TX mode; up to 
100m on Category 3 UTP cable for 10Base-T mode. The all-digital nature of the design makes the BCM50685 
very tolerant to noise. The filter coefficients are self-adapting to accommodate varying conditions of cable 
quality and cable length.

Echo Canceler
Because of the bidirectional nature of the channel in 1000Base-T modes, an echo impairment is caused by each 
transmitter. The output of the echo filter is added to the FFE output to remove the transmitted signal 
impairment from the incoming receive signal. The echo canceler coefficients are self-adapting to manage the 
varying echo impulse responses caused by different channels, transmitters, and environmental conditions.

Crosstalk CancelerBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Crosstalk Canceler
The BCM50685 transmits and receives a continuous data stream on four channels in gigabit mode. For a given 
channel, the signals sent by the other three local transmitters cause impairments on the received signal 
because of near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the pairs. It is possible to cancel the effect because each 
receiver has access to the data for the other three pairs that cause this interference. The output of the adaptive 
NEXT canceling filters is added to the FFE output to cancel the NEXT impairment.

Analog-to-Digital Converter
Each receive channel has its own 125 MHz analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that samples the incoming data 
on the receive channel and feeds the output to the digital adaptive equalizer. Advanced analog circuit 
techniques achieve the following results:

• Low offset • High-power supply 
noise rejection

• Fast settling time • Low bit error rate

Clock Recovery/Generator
The clock recovery and generator block creates the transmit and receive clocks for 1000Base-T, 100Base-TX, 
and 10Base-T operation. In 10Base-T or 100Base-TX mode, the transmit clock is locked to the 25 MHz crystal 
input, and the receive clock is locked to the incoming data stream.

In 1000Base-T mode, the two ends of the link perform loop timing. One end of the link is configured as the 
master, and the other is configured as the slave. The master transmit and receive clocks are locked to the 
25 MHz crystal input. The slave transmit and receive clocks are locked to the incoming receive data stream. 
Loop timing allows for the cancellation of echo and NEXT impairments by ensuring that the transmitter and 
receiver at each end of the link are operating at the same frequency.

Baseline Wander Correction
1000Base-T and 100Base-TX data streams are not always DC-balanced. Because the receive signal must pass 
through a transformer, the DC offset of the differential receive input can vary with data content. This effect, 
which is known as baseline wander, can greatly reduce the noise immunity of the receiver. The BCM50685 
automatically compensates for baseline wander by removing the DC offset from the input signal, thereby 
significantly reducing the probability of a receive symbol error.

In 10Base-T mode, baseline wander correction is not performed because the Manchester coding provides a 
perfect DC balance.

Multimode TX Digital-to-Analog ConverterBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Multimode TX Digital-to-Analog Converter
The multimode transmit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) transmits PAM5, MLT3, and Manchester coded 
symbols. The transmit DAC performs signal wave shaping that decreases the unwanted high frequency signal 
components, reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI). The transmit DAC uses a current drive output that 
is well-balanced, and therefore, produces very low-noise transmit signals.

Stream Cipher
In 1000Base-T and 100Base-TX modes, the transmit data stream is scrambled to reduce radiated emissions and 
to ensure that there are adequate transitions within the data stream. The 1000Base-T scrambler also ensures 
that there is no correlation among symbols on the four different wire pairs and in the transmit and receive data 
streams. The scrambler reduces peak emissions by randomly spreading the signal energy over the transmit 
frequency range and eliminating peaks at certain frequencies. The randomization of the data stream also 
assists the digital adaptive equalizers and echo/crosstalk cancelers. The algorithms in these circuits require that 
there be no sequential or cross-channel correlation among symbols in the various data streams.

In 100Base-TX mode, the transmit data stream is scrambled by exclusive ORing the encoded serial data stream. 
This is done with the output of an 11-bit wide linear feedback shift register (LFSR), producing a 2047-bit non-
repeating sequence.

In 1000Base-T mode, the transmit data stream is scrambled by exclusive ORing the input data byte with an 8-
bit wide cipher text word. The cipher text word generates each symbol period from eight uncorrelated maximal 
length data sequences that are produced by linear remapping of the output of a 33-bit wide LFSR. After the 
scrambled data bytes are encoded, the sign of each transmitted symbol is again randomized by a 4-bit wide 
cipher text word that is generated in the same manner as the 8-bit word. The master and slave transmitters 
use different scrambler sequences to generate the cipher text words. For repeater or switch applications, 
where all ports can transmit the same data simultaneously, signal energy is randomized further by using a 
unique seed to initialize the scrambler sequence for each PHY.

The receiver descrambles the incoming data stream by exclusive ORing it with the same sequence generated 
at the transmitter. The descrambler detects the state of the transmit LFSR by looking for a sequence 
representing consecutive idle code groups. The descrambler locks to the scrambler state after detecting a 
sufficient number of consecutive idle codes. The BCM50685 enables transmission and reception of packet data 
only when the descrambler is locked. The receiver continually monitors the input data stream to ensure that it 
has not lost synchronization by checking that inter-packet gaps containing idles or frame extensions are 
received at expected intervals. When the BCM50685 detects loss of synchronization, it notifies the link partner 
of the inability to receive packets (1000Base-T mode only) and attempts to resynchronize to the received data 
stream. If the descrambler is unable to resynchronize for a period of 750 ms, the BCM50685 is forced into the 
Link Fail state.

In 10Base-T mode, scrambling is not required to reduce radiated emissions.

Wire Map and Pair Skew CorrectionBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Wire Map and Pair Skew Correction
During 1000Base-T operation, the BCM50685 has the ability to automatically detect and correct some UTP 
cable wiring errors. The symbol decoder detects and compensates for (internal to the BCM50685) the following 
errors:

• Wiring errors caused 
by the swapping of 

pairs within the UTP 
cable

• Polarity errors caused 
by the swapping of 

wires within a pair

The BCM50685 also automatically compensates for differences in the arrival times of symbols on the four pairs 
of the UTP cable. The varying arrival times are caused by differing propagation delays (commonly referred to 
as delay skew) between the wire pairs. The BCM50685 can tolerate delay skews of up to 64 ns long. Auto-
negotiation must be enabled to take advantage of the wire map correction.

During 10/100 Mbps operation, pair swaps are corrected. Delay skew is not an issue though, because only one 
pair of wires is used in each direction.

Automatic MDI Crossover
During copper auto-negotiation, one end of the link needs to perform an MDI crossover so that each 
transceiver’s transmitter is connected to the other receiver. The BCM50685 can perform an automatic media 
dependent interface (MDI) crossover, eliminating the need for crossover cables or cross-wired (MDIX) ports. 
During auto-negotiation, the BCM50685 normally transmits on the TRD[0]{8:1}± pins and receives on the 
TRD[1]{8:1}± pins.

When connecting to another device that does not perform MDI crossover, the BCM50685 automatically 
switches its TRD[0]{8:1}± and TRD[1]{8:1}± pin pairs when necessary to communicate with the remote device. 
When connecting to another device that does have MDI crossover capability, an algorithm determines which 
end performs the crossover function.

The MDI Crossover State can be determined by reading register 11h, bit 13.

• 0 = Normal MDI mode • 1 = Crossover MDI mode

1000Base-T Operation
During 1000Base-T operation, the BCM50685 swaps the transmit symbols on pairs 0 and 1 and pairs 2 and 3 if 
auto-negotiation completes in the MDI crossover state. The 1000Base-T receiver automatically detects pair 
swaps on the receive inputs and aligns the symbols properly within the decoder. The automatic MDI crossover 
function can not be disabled when in 1000Base-T mode.

10/100Base-TX Operation (Auto-Negotiation Enabled)
During 10Base-T and 100Base-TX operation, pair swaps automatically occur within the device and do not 
require user intervention. The automatic MDI crossover function by default only works when auto-negotiation 
is enabled. This function can be disabled during auto-negotiation by writing to register 10h, bit 14 = 1.

Auto-NegotiationBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

10/100Base-TX Operation (Forced Mode)
The automatic MDI crossover function can also be enabled when in forced 10Base-T or forced 100Base-TX 
mode. This feature allows the user to disable the copper auto-negotiation in either 10Base-T or 100Base-TX 
and still take advantage of the automatic MDI crossover function. This feature is enabled by writing register 
18h, shadow 7h, bit 9 = 1.

When in forced 10Base-T or 100Base-TX mode the BCM50685 has a feature that can manually swap the MDI 
state when the automatic MDI crossover function is disabled. Normally the BCM50685 transmits on the 
TRD[0]{8:1}± pins and receives on the TRD[1]{8:1}± pins, but by setting register 1Eh, bit 7 = 1 the MDI state can 
be changed so that the BCM50685 transmits on the TRD[1]{8:1}± pins and receives on the TRD[0]{8:1}± pins. 

Auto-Negotiation

Copper Mode
The BCM50685, when configured for the copper mode, negotiates its mode of operation over the copper 
media using the auto-negotiation mechanism, defined in the IEEE 802.3u and 802.3ab specifications. When the 
auto-negotiation function is enabled, the BCM50685 automatically chooses the mode of operation by 
advertising its abilities and comparing them with those received from its link partner. The BCM50685 can be 
configured to advertise the following modes:

• 1000Base-T full-
duplex and/or half-

duplex

• 100Base-TX full-

duplex and/or half-
duplex

• 10Base-T full-duplex 
and/or half-duplex

The transceiver negotiates with its link partner and chooses the highest common operating speed and duplex 
mode, commonly referred to as highest common denominator (HCD). Auto-negotiation can be enabled or 
disabled by hardware and software control, but is always required for 1000Base-T operation. 

QSGMII Mode
When configured to QSGMII mode, the BCM50685 copper interface auto-negotiates based on Clauses 28 and 
40 of IEEE 802.3. The QSGMII auto-negotiates according to 1000Base-X auto-negotiation as described in IEEE 
802.3, Clause 37, except for a few changes to operate in QSGMII mode. The link timer is reduced to 1.6 ms, and 
the auto-negotiation code word is changed to reflect the copper link, copper duplex, and copper speed. 
QSGMII, based on the PHY port’s MDI negotiation, auto-negotiates per clause 37 in IEEE 802.3 with several 
modifications for QSGMII operation. More information is available in Cisco® document EDCS-540123 “QSGMII 
Specification.”

Operational DescriptionBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Section 5: Operational Description

Power Sequencing
It is recommended that the higher supply be brought up first (for example: 3.3V first, then 2.5V and then 1.2V) 
or at the same time as the lower supplies. This is only a recommendation and not a requirement. The 
BCM50685 does not have any specific power sequencing requirements. 

Resetting the BCM50685

Hardware Reset
The BCM50685 provides a hardware reset pin, RESET, which resets all internal nodes to a known state. 
Hardware reset is accomplished by holding the RESET pin low for at least 10 ms after the power supply voltages 
and clocks are stable. Once RESET is brought high, the PHY completes its reset sequence within 20 μs. All 
outputs are inactive until the PHY has completed its reset sequence. The PHY keeps the inputs inactive for 5 ms 
after the deassertion of hardware reset. The hardware configuration pins and the PHY address pins are read on 
the deassertion of hardware reset. 

Software Reset

The BCM50685 has two methods for performing software reset.

The first method reset all eight ports and behaves like hardware reset. Software reset will set all the PHY 
registers to the default values and hardware strap pins that are labelled sample on reset (SOR) are relatched. 
To enable the software reset, set bit 15 = 1 in register 00h. This bit is self-clearing. There is no effect if 0 is 
written to this bit.

The second method resets only the status registers but preserves all the MII registers that are writable. The 
strap options are not relatched. This reset is done on a port by port basis. To enable the software reset, set bit 
0 = 1 in Expansion Register 70h. This needs to be done to every port that needs resetting. This bit is self-
clearing. There is no effect if 0 is written to this bit.

Caution! The RESET pin must be asserted during power up.

Reference ClockBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Reference Clock
The BCM50685 can support a reference clock using the QREF_CLK± inputs at either 125 MHz or 156.25 MHz. 
There are two different reference clock schemes that can be used. Table 7 shows the two schemes.

Figure 7:  125 MHz or 156.25 MHz Differential QREF_CLKì � ,QSXW

125 MHz or 156.25 MHz QREF_CLK± Mode
Figure 7 shows a typical differential connection. When programmed into this mode the BCM50685 can use 
either a 125 MHz or a 156.25 MHz differential clock. The differential clock when using the QREF_CLK± inputs 
must be AC-coupled. There is no need for external termination on the inputs. The inputs have a differential 80Ω 
to 100Ω impedance integrated on-chip.

When 156.25MHz QREF_CLK± mode is selected, Expansion 55h bit 9 must be set to 1 for ports 2/8 and 6/8.

PHY AddressBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

PHY Address 
The BCM50685 has nine unique PHY addresses for MII management. Eight for PHY address pins and one for 
the QSGMII interface. PHY address for the ports are set to the following:

• Port 1 is set through 
the PHYA[4:0] pins

• Port 2 is the PHY 
address pins + 1

• Port 3 is the PHY 

address pins + 2

• Port 4 is the PHY 
address pins + 3

• Port 5 is the PHY 
address pins + 4

• Port 6 is the PHY 
address pins + 5

• Port 7 is the PHY 
address pins + 6

• Port 8 is the PHY 

address pins + 7

• QSGMII is the PHY 
address pins +8

The pins are latched at the trailing end of reset. A single MDC/MDIO bus can be used for multiple BCM50685 
devices. The PHY address pins must be strapped so that each octal device is at every eight addresses (X, X+8, 
X+16,..., X+32). Duplicate PHY addresses cannot exist in a single MDC/MDIO bus. There is a maximum of three 
BCM50685 devices per MDIO bus or 32 unique PHY addresses.

Every time an MII write or read operation is performed, the transceiver checks whether the PHY address in the 
instruction matches with its own PHY address definition. The operation is performed only when the addresses 
match. The PHY address of the port can only be set by hardware.

Super Isolate ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Super Isolate Mode
When in Super Isolate mode, the transmit and receive functions on the Copper Media Dependent Interface are 
disabled (No link is be established with the PHY’s copper link partner). A QSGMII link between the BCM50685 
and switch is established if the switch sends back an acknowledgement to the BCM50685 through the QSGMII 
auto-negotiation link code word. If the switch does not send back an acknowledgement, the PHY remains in 
auto-negotiation mode.

Hardware Enable
The BCM50685 has an additional hardware-strapping pin that can put the BCM50685 into Super Isolate mode 
right after a software or hardware reset. When Super Isolate mode is entered via the hardware-strapping pin, 
all eight ports are affected. To enable Super Isolate mode, pull the Super Isolate (SUPER_I) pin high at reset. 
The Super Isolate pin is sampled at reset and has an internal pull-down resistor. Super Isolate mode is disabled 
on a per-port basis. To disable Super Isolate mode, write to ”1000Base-T/100Base-TX/10Base-T Power/MII 
Control Register (Address 18h, Shadow 2h)” on page 131, bit 5 = 0 for each of the eight ports.

Software Enable
The BCM50685 can be put into Super Isolate mode on a per port basis by software. To enable Super Isolate

Standby Power-Down Mode 
The BCM50685 can be placed into standby Power-down mode using software commands. In this mode, all PHY 
functions, except for the serial management interface, are disabled. To enter standby Power-down mode, set 
MII Control register (Address 00h), bit 11 = 1. There are three ways to exit standby Power-down mode:

• Clear MII Control 
register (address 

00h), bit 11 = 0

• Set the software reset 

bit 15, MII Control 
register (address 00h)

• Assert the hardware 
RESET pin

Reads or writes to any MII register, other than MII Control register (address 00h) while the device is in the 
standby Power-down mode, returns unpredictable results. Upon exiting standby Power-down mode, the 
BCM50685 remains in an internal reset state for 40 µs, and then resumes normal operation.

Auto Power-Down ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Auto Power-Down Mode
The BCM50685 can be placed into an auto Power-down mode. Auto Power-down mode reduces chip power 
when the signal from the copper link partner is not present. The auto Power-down mode works whether the 
device is in auto-negotiation Enabled or Forced mode. This mode is enabled by setting bit 5 = 1 in “Auto Power-
Down Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 0Ah)”. When auto Power-down mode is enabled, the BCM50685 
automatically enters the Low-power mode when energy on the line is lost, and it resumes normal operation 
when energy is detected. When the BCM50685 is in Auto Power-down mode, it wakes up after 2.7s or 5.4s 
(determined by bit 4 in “Auto Power-Down Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 0Ah)”) and sends link pulses while 
monitoring for energy from the link partner. The BCM50685 enters normal operation and establishes a link if 
energy is detected, otherwise, the Wake-up mode continues for a duration of 84 ms to 1260 ms. This is 
determined by the timer bits[3:0] in “Auto Power-Down Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 0Ah)” before going 
back to Low-power mode.

SGMII PCS Loopback Mode
This mode allows the testing of the SGMII interface from the Link Partner. The receive packet from the Link 
Partner is sent to the SGIN± pins and passed through the PCS and sent back out the SGOUT± pins back to the 
MDI Link Partner. There is one mode supported when in SGMII PCS loopback mode.

• SGMII PCS loopback 
with RX data 

suppressed from the 
MDI and TX data 

suppressed to the 
MDI

The speed of the BCM50685’s SGMII interface and the speed of the Link Partner’s SGMII interface must match. 
The speed on the BCM50685’s MDI interface determines the speed of the BCM50685’s SGMII interface. There 
are two methods to set the BCM50685’s SGMII interface speed. The first method is by turning auto-negotiation 
off and forcing the MDI speed of the BCM50685. The second method is by linking up to a copper link partner 
either through auto-negotiation or through force mode. The following two sections describe how to set the 
BCM50685 into forced and auto-negotiation mode.

External Loopback ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

External Loopback Mode
The External Loopback mode allows in-circuit testing of the BCM50685, as well as the transmit path through 
the magnetics and the RJ-45 connector. External Loopback can be performed with and without a jumper block. 
External loopback using a jumper block tests the path through the magnetics and RJ45 connector. External 
loopback without the jumper block only tests the BCM50685’s transmit and receive circuitry. In 1000Base-T, 
100Base-TX, and 10Base-T modes, a jumper block must be inserted into the RJ-45 connector to support 
external loopback. The jumper block should have the following RJ-45 pins connected together:

Full-Duplex ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Full-Duplex Mode 
The BCM50685 supports full-duplex operation. While in full-duplex mode, a transceiver can simultaneously 
transmit and receive packets on the cable.

Copper Mode
When auto-negotiation is disabled, full-duplex operation can be enabled by setting bit 8 of the “1000Base-T/
100Base-TX/10Base-T MII Control Register (Address 00h)”.

When auto-negotiation is enabled, the full-duplex capability is advertised for:

• 10Base-T; when bit 6 
in the “1000Base-T/
100Base-TX/10Base-T 
Auto-Negotiation 
Advertisement 

Register (Address 
04h)” is set.

• 1000Base-T; when bit 

9 in the “1000Base-T 
Control Register 
(Address 09h)” is set.

Ethernet@Wirespeed™
Ethernet@Wirespeed is an enhancement to Auto-negotiation that allows a network connection even over 
impaired cable plants. If a link can not be established at the highest common denominator within a 
programmable number of link attempts then the BCM50685 advertises the next highest advertised speed using 
auto-negotiation. Below is an example of how Ethernet@Wirespeed works.

At start-up the BCM50685 is advertising 1000Base-T, 100Base-TX, and 10Base-T capabilities per registers 04h 
and 09h and the Link Partner is also advertising the same capabilities:

• If a link cannot be 
established within a 
programmable 
number of link 
attempts (two to 
nine) with 1000Base-
T being advertised 
then an 
Ethernet@Wirespeed 
downgrade occurs, 
the 1000Base-T 
capability is masked 
out on the BCM50685 

and the next highest 
advertised capability 
(100Base-TX) is 
advertised.

• If a link cannot be 
established within a 
programmable 
number of link 
attempts (two to 
nine) with 100Base-
TX being advertised 
then an 
Ethernet@Wirespeed 

downgrade occurs, 
the 100Base-TX is 
masked out on the 
BCM50685 and the 
next highest 
advertised capability 
(10Base-T) is 
advertised.

• If a link can not be 
established within a 
programmable 
number of link 
attempts (two to 

nine) with 10Base-T 
being advertised then 
an 
Ethernet@Wirespeed 
downgrade occurs 
and all advertising 
capabilities are 
enabled (1000Base-T, 
100Base-TX, and 
10Base-T) on the 
BCM50685 and the 
whole process begins 
again.

Ethernet@Wirespeed™BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

The BCM50685 has a link up timer that times how long the link has been up. If the link stays up for at least 2.68 
seconds then the number of failed link attempts gets reset to zero and the BCM50685 advertises the highest 
speed when it tries to establish link. The purpose of the link-up timer is to prevent scenarios where the link 
never gets established at a lower speed because the link at the higher speed is unstable and is going up and 
down quickly. In this situation, if the link at the higher speed stays up for less than 2.68 seconds the number of 
link failed attempts gets incremented and the BCM50685 tries to establish link at a lower speed.

The link up timer can be bypassed by setting register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 10 = 1. Setting this bit causes the 
number of failed link attempts to get reset to zero after every link up condition, no matter how short the link 
up time is. 

In addition Ethernet@Wirespeed downgrade can be removed by any of the following events:

• Unplug cable (no 
energy) for 5.4 
seconds

• Hardware reset

• Software reset (reg. 
00h, bit 15 = 1)

• Disable auto-
negotiation (reg. 00h, 
bit 12 = 0)

• Restart auto-
negotiation (reg. 00h, 
bit 9 = 1)

• Disabling Wirespeed 

(reg. 18h, shadow 7h, 
bit 4 = 1)

• Autoneg resolves to 
no HCD (Highest 
Common 
Denominator)

• Programmable (2 to 

5) fails of the lowest 
supported speed 
wraps back to the 
original highest 
advertised speed.

Software Enable
Disabling Ethernet@Wirespeed is disabled on a per-port basis through software. To disable 
Ethernet@Wirespeed mode, write to register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 4 = 0 for each port to be disabled. 

Changing the Number of Failed Link Attempts before Ethernet@Wirespeed 
Downgrade
The number of failed link attempts before downgrading to a slower speed is programmable. The number can 
be programmed anywhere from two to nine failed link attempts before downgrading to a lower speed. The 
default value is five failed link attempts. The number of failed link attempts before downgrading to a lower 
speed can be programmed by writing to register 1Ch, shadow 4h, bits[4:2] as shown Table 14.

Note: The number of failed link attempts before downgrading to a slower speed is programmable. The 
number can be programmed anywhere from two to nine failed link attempts before downgrading to a 
lower speed. The default value is five failed link attempts. See “Changing the Number of Failed Link

Master/Slave Configuration 
In 1000Base-T mode, the BCM50685 and its link partner perform loop timing. One end of the link must be 
configured as the timing master and the other end as the slave. Master/slave configuration is performed by the 
auto-negotiation function. The auto-negotiation function first looks at the manual master/slave configuration 
bits advertised by the local PHY and the link partner. If neither PHY requests manual configuration, then the 
auto-negotiation function looks at the advertised repeater/DTE settings. If one PHY is advertised as a repeater 
port and the other is advertised as a DTE port, then the repeater port is configured as the master and the DTE 
port the slave. Each end generates an 11-bit random seed if the two settings are equal; the end with the higher 
seed is configured as the master. If the local PHY and the link partner generate the same random seed, then 
auto-negotiation is restarted.

If both ends of the link attempt to force the same manual configuration (both master or both slave), or the 
random seeds match seven consecutive times, then the BCM50685 sets the Master/Slave Configuration Fault 
bit in the 1000Base-T Status register and auto-negotiation is restarted. 

For setting the BCM50685 to manual master/slave configuration or to set the advertised repeater/DTE 
configuration, see “1000Base-T Control Register (Address 09h)”.

Next Page ExchangeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Next Page Exchange 
The 1000Base-T configuration requires the exchange of three auto-negotiation next pages between the 
BCM50685 and its link partner. Exchange of 1000Base-T Next Page information takes place automatically when 
the BCM50685 is configured to advertise 1000Base-T capability.

The BCM50685 also supports software-controlled Next Page exchanges. When bit 15 of “1000Base-T/100Base-
TX/10Base-T Auto-Negotiation Advertisement Register (Address 04h)” is written to a 1, all Next Page 
transactions are controlled through the MII management interface. This includes the three 1000Base-T Next 
Pages, which are always sent first. The BCM50685 automatically generates the appropriate message code field 
for the 1000Base-T pages. When the BCM50685 is not configured to advertise 1000Base-T capability, the 
1000Base-T Next Pages are not sent.

When the BCM50685 is not configured to advertise 1000Base-T capability and bit 15 of the “1000Base-T/

SGMII or Fiber InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

SGMII or Fiber Interface
The SGMII interface uses two data signals to convey frame-data and link-rate information between the 
BCM50685 transceiver and a SGMII Master device or Fiber link partner. The data signals operate at 1.25 gbaud, 
and the clocks operate at a 625 MHz double data rate (DDR) interface. Each of these signals is realized as a 
differential pair because of the speed of operation, providing signal integrity while minimizing system noise. 
The SGMII signals use LVDS voltage levels. Both the data and clock signals are DC-balanced. However, because 
the SGMII interface operates off of 1.2V instead of 2.5V like in legacy SGMII/fiber applications, AC coupling with 
coupling capacitors is highly recommended.

The 1.25 gbaud transfer rate of the SGMII is greater than required for the BCM50685 transceiver operating at 
10 Mbps or 100 Mbps. When these situations occur, the BCM50685 elongates the frame by replicating each 
frame byte 10 times for 100 Mbps and 100 times for 10 Mbps. This frame elongation takes place above the 
802.3z PCS layer, making the start-frame delimiter appear only once per frame.

At the receive side, the BCM50685 transceiver passes the signals from the copper interface through the 
BCM50685 PCS layer. The BCM50685 serializes the PCS data to create a SGOUT± signal pair, and sends it to the 
Switch at a 1.25 Gbps data rate.

At the transmit side, the BCM50685 de-serializes the SGIN± signal pair to recover encoded parallel data. The 
BCM50685 passes parallel data through the PCS receive state machine to recover the transmit signals. The 
decoded transmit signals are passed through the transmit block and output to the BCM50685 copper port with 
a predetermined speed.

Control Information Exchanged Between Links
When configured for SGMII mode as SGMII Master, it is necessary for the BCM50685 to pass control 
information to the switch to notify the change of the link status. The SGMII interface uses the auto-negotiation 
block to pass control information. If the BCM50685 detects the link change, it starts its auto-negotiation 
process, sending out the updated control information. The receive block in the Switch receives and decodes 
control information and starts the auto-negotiation process. The transmit block in the Switch acknowledges 
the update of the link status. Upon receiving the acknowledgement from the Switch, the BCM50685 completes 
the auto-negotiation process and returns to the normal data mode.

LED InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Configuring the PHY for Fiber Mode
By default, the PHY is configured for QSGMII to copper mode (copper is selected when no medium is active) 
with auto-detect medium enabled (1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 0=1). This allows the link-up of either copper MDI or 
fiber MDI, with fiber MDI preferred, if both interfaces are active. SD must be inverted by setting 1Ch shadow 
1Eh bit 7=0.

1000Base-X MII registers are selected by setting 1Ch shadow 1Fh.0=1.

To place the part into fiber-only mode:

Set 1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 2=1 to select fiber as the only active MDI media. Set 1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 0=0 to turn 
off auto-detection between copper and fiber media.

LED Interface
There are four basic LED modes that the BCM50685 supports.The four modes are:

• Parallel LED Mode • External Serial LED 
Mode

• Serial LED Mode • Low Cost Serial LED 
Mode

Parallel LED Mode
The BCM50685 has eight programmable LED pins per port that perform different functions. Each of the 
BCM50685 LEDs can be individually programmed to any one of the many LED modes on a per-port basis. The 
available LED modes are:

• LINKSPD1

• LINKSPD2

• XMITLED 

• ACTIVITY

• FDXLED

• SLAVE

• INTR

• QUALITY

• RCVLED

• WIRESPEED 
DOWNGRADE

• MULTICOLOR[1]

• MULTICOLOR[2]

• CABLE DIAG (Open/
Short found)

• SGMII RECEIVING CRS

• ON

• OFF

Any LED programmed for the above modes, except for INTR LED, behaves as an active low push-pull outputs. 
Any LED programmed to INTR behaves as an active low open-drain output.

External Serial LED Interface
External Serial LED mode provides a means for system vendors to control the BCM50685’s LED behavior 
directly by providing a LED serial stream to the BCM50685. This LED stream is strobed into and out of the chip 
with a serial clock that may run up to 25 MHz. A strobe signal is provided to asynchronously shift data from the 
serializer to the LED output buffers on a rising edge. Figure 1 shows the Serial LED block diagram. Table 2 shows 
the External Serial LED hardware balls and Table 3 shows the software bits used for External Serial LED mode. 
The External Serial LEDs (SLED[1:32]) are mapped to the PHY’s Port LEDs as shown in Table TBD. Even though 
the Serial LEDs (SLED[1:31]) are mapped to the physical Port 1 to Port 8 leds, the incoming serial stream does 
not have to be mapped to the Port 1 to Port 8 leds. The customer determines the serial stream specifics.

LED InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Serial LED Mode
Serial LED mode requires the use of external serial-to-parallel shift registers such as multiple 74HC594 devices. 
This mode is based on a serial data stream (SL_DO), a serial data clock (SL_CLK) and a framing signal 
(SL_FRAME) use for latching the serial data through the parallel registers within the external devices. 

• SL_DO is an active 
low bit stream 
containing 48 bits per 
frame.

• SL_CLK runs at 
approximately 3 MHz 
and is used to clock 
out SL_DO on the 

falling edge.

• SL_Frame is an active 
high pulse that occurs 
once every 48 SL_DO 

bit times. The 
SL_FRAME goes high 
coincident with bit 0 
of port 1.

The 48 bit SL_DO output stream will output PORT1 bit(1) first and PORT8 bit(6) last. See sequence below.

Enabling Serial LED Mode
Serial LED mode can be enabled by setting bit 13 = 1 in Expansion Register 71h. Expansion Registers 71h and 
72h allow bits[6:1] can be programmed for the following modes: 

• LINKSPD1

• LINKSPD2

• XMITLED 

• ACTIVITY

• FDXLED

• SLAVE

• INTR

• QUALITY

• RCVLED

• WIRESPEED 
DOWNGRADE

• CABLE DIAG (Open/

Short found)

• SGMII RECEIVING CRS

• ON

• OFF

Low Cost Serial LED Mode 
Low Cost Serial LED mode is a simplified version that does not require a framing pulse for port data delineation. 
The mode requires the use of inexpensive shift registers such as multiple 74HC164 devices. The mode is based 
on a serial data stream (SL_DO) and a serial data clock (SL_CLK).

• SL_DO is an active 
low bit stream 
containing 48 bits per 
frame.The data is 
shifted so the 

updated of LEDs using 
a shift register that 
drives the display 
LEDs does not cause a 
noticeable flicker in 

normal operation. 

• SL_CLK runs at 
approximately 12.5 
MHz and is used to 
clock out SL_DO on 

the falling edge. The 
48 LED signals will get 
shifted out within a 
3.84us burst.

The 48 bit SL_DO output stream will output PORT1 bit(1) first and PORT8 bit(6) last. See sequence below.

Temperature Monitor
The BCM50685 uses an integrated temperature sensor to monitor the device temperature. The measurement 
relies on the characteristics of a semiconductor junction to calculate temperature. The analog sensing signal is 
preprocessed by signal conditioning circuitry, and it is then digitized by an ADC. Its value is stored in the local 
temperature data register (Expansion register 0Bh of port 4). When the measured temperature exceeds the 
respective threshold level, the temperature monitoring unit can generate an interrupt signal, and the event 
sets Expansion register 0Bh of port 4 bit 0. The interrupt signal can be masked by setting the Top Level MII Temp 
Monitor register offset 16h bit 7.

To enable the temperature monitoring function, set bit 5 of Top Level MII Temp Monitor register offset 16h to 
0 and Top Level 01h Bit 0 to 1. 

After powering-up the thermal monitoring function, the unit requires a 1.2 ms wait time before thermal data 
is converged. Thereafter, the thermal value is updated every 400 μs.

The BCM50685 measured temperature (Tm) value can be calculated using the following equation:

Tm = 267.75  –  0.7 x 
Temp Code,

where measured 
temperature (Tm) is 

in Celsius. 

The Temp Code value is a decimal in this equation. The temp code value can be read from 
Table 104: “Expansion Register 0Bh: Temperature Monitor PHYA[4:0]+3,” on page 217, bits 15:7. This value is 
in hexadecimal and it must be converted into the decimal for this equation.

Broadcom Serial Control (BSC) InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Broadcom Serial Control (BSC) Interface
The BCM50685’s registers can be programmed through an external EEPROM through the BCM50685’s BSC 
interface. The BSC interface is compatible with the Phillips® I2C interface.This feature is useful in unmanaged 
systems.

The BCM50685’s BSC interface is a two wire Serial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA) open collector interface. 
Devices connected to it are classified as either master or slave. Although BSC protocol supports multiple master 
designs, the interface described by this document is a single master implementation. Serial EEPROMs and 
ROMs are considered slave devices. The SCL pin is driven by the master only. The SDA is bi-directional. The 
interface signaling can be categorized into a few simple functions. Start, Stop, Transmit and Receive. 

A transaction is initiated with a "Start". Start is defined by SDA going from high to low while SCL is high. The 
master then begins clocking out a byte that contains a 4 bit device code, a 3 bit select address and a R/W bit. 
All BSC memories use the device code "1010". During normal data transmission, data is only allowed to 
transition during the low period of SCL. If a device that recognizes the device code is listening on the bus, it 
acknowledges on the ninth clock by pulling SDA low.

A random access transaction always begins with a "write" operation to set the beginning address. This is 
accomplished by transmitting a '0' in the LS Bit of the device code byte. After the device code write (DCW) is 
acknowledged by the memory, the master clocks out one or two more bytes depending upon the size of the 
PROM/ROM. This is the starting address. A memory with more than 256 bytes will require two bytes of address, 
256 and less only one. If the desired transaction is a write, the master can simply continue writing until it is 
finished or the memory's buffer is full. 

Following every 8 bits of data, the master relinquishes the SDA line and the slave drives it low to acknowledge 
the receipt of the byte. When the master has completed the write, it issues a stop. Stop is defined as a low to 
high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. If the transaction is a read, after the address is written, another 
start is issued and the device code is sent with the LS Bit high (DCR). After the slave acknowledges the device 
code, it begins transmitting one bit of data per clock. Data is valid during the high period of the clock. After 8 
bits have been read, the master issues an ack. Upon receipt, the slave automatically increments it's internal 
address and begins transfer of the next byte. Reading continues until the master issues a nack at the end of a 
byte, or a start or stop is issued. The internal address register of the memory always points one address past 
the last byte accessed by a read or write operation.

Register SummaryBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Section 6: Register Summary

MII Management Interface Register Programming
The BCM50685 transceiver is fully compliant with the MII clause of the IEEE 802.3u Ethernet specification. The 
MII management interface registers are written and read serially, using the MDIO and MDC pins. A clock of up 
to 12.5 MHz must drive the MDC pin of the BCM50685. Data transferred to and from the MDIO0 and MDIO1 
pins is synchronized with the MDC0 and MDC1 clocks, respectively. The following section lists the components 
in each MII read or write instruction.

Preamble (PRE)
To signal the beginning of an MII instruction after reset, at least 32 consecutive 1 bits must be written to the 
MDIO pin of the BCM50685. A preamble of thirty-two 1 bits is required only for the first read or write following 
reset. If bit 6 of MII register 01h is cleared, a preamble is always required. A preamble of fewer than thirty-two 
1 bits causes the remainder of the instruction to be ignored.

Start of Frame (ST)
A 01 pattern indicates the start of the instruction follows.

Operation Code (OP)
A read instruction is indicated by 10, while a write instruction is indicated by 01.

PHY Address (PHYAD)
A 5-bit PHY address follows, with the MSB transmitted first. The PHY address allows a single MDIO bus to access 
multiple PHY chips.

Register Address (REGAD)
A 5-bit register address follows, with the MSB transmitted first. The addresses for the registers used by the 
BCM50685 are shown in Table 20 on page 83.

Turnaround (TA)
The next bit times are used to avoid contention on the MDIO pin when a read operation is performed. When a 
write operation is being performed, 10 must be sent to the BCM50685 chip during these 2 bit times. When a 
read operation is being performed, the MDIO pin of the Switch must be put in a high-impedance state during 
these bit times. The BCM50685 transceiver drives the MDIO pin to 0 during the second bit time.

MII Management Interface Register ProgrammingBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Data
The last 16 bits of the Instruction are the actual data bits. During a write operation, these bits are written to 
the MDIO pin with the most significant bit (MSB) transmitted first. During a read operation, the data bits are 
driven by the BCM50685 with the MSB transmitted first.

Table 19 summarizes the complete management frame format.

When writing to the MDIO pin, the bit value must be stable for 10 nanoseconds before the rising edge of the 
MDC, and must be held valid for 10 nanoseconds after the rising edge of the MDC. When reading from the 
MDIO pin, the data bit is valid at the rising edge of the MDC until the next falling edge of the MDC.

Example: To put a 
PHY with address 
00001 into Loopback 
mode, issue the 
following write MII 
instruction: 

1111 1111 1111 1111 
1111 1111 1111 
1111    0101 00001 
00000 10 0100 0000 
0000 0000

To determine if a PHY 

is in the link pass 
state, issue the 
following read MII 
instruction: 
1111 1111 1111 1111 
1111 1111 1111 

1111    0110 00001 
00001 ZZ ZZZZ ZZZZ 
ZZZZ ZZZZ

The BCM50685 drives the MDIO line during the last 17 bit times. If the link status is good, the third bit from the 
end (bit 2) is 1.

1000Base-T/100Base-TX/10Base-T MII Control
This register is enabled by writing to:

• “Mode Control Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 1Fh)” bit 0 = 0.

Reset
To reset the BCM50685 by software control, a 1 must be written to bit 15 of the MII Control register. This bit 
clears itself after the reset process is complete, and does not need to be cleared using a second MII write. 
Writes to other MII Control register bits have no effect until the reset process is completed, which requires 
approximately 2.0 µs. Writing a 0 to this bit has no effect. A 1 is returned when this bit is read during the reset 
process; otherwise, it returns a 0.

BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Internal Loopback
When enabled packets received on the SGIN± pins will be loopback out the SGOUT± pins. 

Speed Selection (LSB)
When auto-negotiation is disabled, bits 6 and 13 of the MII Control register can be used to manually select the 
speed of operation. When bit 6 is set and bit 13 is cleared, 1000Base-T operation is selected. When bit 6 is 
cleared and bit 13 is set, 100Base-TX operation is selected. When both bits are cleared, 10Base-T operation is 
selected. Setting both bits is not permitted. When read, these bits return the last value written. The default 
value for bit 13 is determined by the state of the SPD0 and F1000 pins at reset. 

Copper Auto-Negotiation Enable
When bit 12 of the MII Control register is set, the BCM50685 mode of operation is controlled by auto-
negotiation. When this bit is cleared, the BCM50685 mode of operation is determined by the Manual Speed, 
Duplex mode, and Master/Slave Configuration bits. A 1 is returned when this bit is read with auto-negotiation 
enabled; otherwise, it returns a 0. The default value of this bit is determined by the state of the ANEN pin at 
reset. 

Power-Down
When bit 11 of the MII Control register is set, the BCM50685 is placed into low-power standby mode. When in 
this mode all BCM50685 functions except for the MDIO/MDC, 1000Base-X and SGMII interfaces.

Restart Auto-Negotiation
Setting bit 9 of the MII Control register forces the auto-negotiation process to be restarted, regardless of the 
current state of the auto-negotiation state machine. When auto-negotiation is enabled, setting this bit restarts 
the auto-negotiation process. Clearing this bit has no effect. This bit is self-clearing. After the auto-negotiation 
process has restarted, it returns a value of 0.

Duplex Mode
When auto-negotiation is disabled, the duplex mode of the BCM50685 can be controlled by writing to bit 8 of 
the MII Control register. Setting this bit forces the BCM50685 into full-duplex operation, and clearing this bit 
forces the BCM50685 into half-duplex operation. The default value of this bit is determined by the FDX pin at 
reset.

The IEEE has issued an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to Broadcom Corporation. This 24-bit number 
allows devices made by Broadcom to be distinguished from all other manufacturers. The OUI combined with 
model numbers and revision numbers assigned by Broadcom precisely identifies a device manufactured by 
Broadcom.

Bits[15:0] of MII register 02h (PHYID HIGH) contain OUI bits[3:18]. Bits[15:0] of MII register 03h (PHYID LOW) 
contain the most significant OUI bits[19:24]: six manufacturer model number bits, and four revision number 
bits. The two least significant OUI binary bits are not used.

Broadcom Corporation's OUI is 00-10-18 (expressed as hexadecimal values). The binary OUI is 0000-0000-
0000-1000-0001-1000. The model number for the BCM50685 is 0Bh. Revision numbers start with 0h and

Next Page
Bit 15 must be set = 1 when the management software wants to control Next Page exchange. When this bit is 
cleared, Next Page exchange is automatically controlled by the BCM50685. When this bit is cleared and the 
BCM50685 is not advertising 1000Base-T capability, no Next Page exchange occurs.

Remote Fault
Setting bit 13 sends a remote fault indication to the link partner during auto-negotiation. Writing a 0 to this bit 
clears the Remote Fault transmission bit. This bit returns a 1 when advertising remote fault; otherwise, it 
returns a 0.

BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Master/Slave Configuration Fault
When a master/slave configuration fault occurs during auto-negotiation, the BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 15. 
When a configuration fault occurs, the bit is latched at 1 and remains so until either the register is read, auto-
negotiation is restarted by writing bit 9 in the MII Control register, or auto-negotiation completes successfully 
with no master/slave configuration fault.

Master/Slave Configuration Resolution
When the BCM50685 transceiver has been configured as the master, it returns a 1 in bit 14. When the 
BCM50685 transceiver has been configured as the slave, it returns a 0.

Local Receiver Status
The BCM50685 transceiver returns a 1 in bit 13 when the local receiver status is good; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Remote Receiver Status
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 12 when the remote receiver status is good; otherwise, it returns a 0.

1000Base-T Full-Duplex Capability
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 11 when the link partner has advertised 1000Base-T full-duplex capability; 
otherwise, it returns a 0.

1000Base-T Half-Duplex Capability
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 10 when the link partner has advertised 1000Base-T half-duplex capability; 
otherwise, it returns a 0.

Idle Error Count
The BCM50685 counts the number of idle errors received while the local receiver status is good. Bits 7 through 
0 return the number of idle errors counted since the last time the register was read. The counter freezes at the 
maximum value (FFh) to prevent overflow.

Note: As indicated by bit 5 of the MII Status register (0h), the values contained in bits 14, 11, and 10 of 
the 1000Base-T Status register are guaranteed to be valid only after auto-negotiation has successfully 
completed.

Transmit Disable
The transmitter can be disabled by setting bit 13 = 1. The copper transmitter outputs are forced into a high 
impedance state. 

Interrupt Disable
When this bit is set = 1, the INTR LED pin is forced to its inactive state.

Force Interrupt
When this bit is set = 1, the INTR LED pin is forced to its active state.

Bypass 4B/5B Encoder/Decoder (100Base-TX)
The 100Base-TX4B/5B encoder/decoder can be bypassed by setting bit 10 = 1. The transmitter sends 5B codes 
from the TX_ER and TXD[3:0] pins directly to the scrambler. TX_EN is ignored and frame encapsulation 
(insertion of J/K and T/R codes) is not performed. The receiver places descrambled and aligned 5B codes onto 
the RX_ER and RXD[3:0] pins. CRS is still asserted when a valid frame is received.

Bypass Scrambler/Descrambler (100Base-TX)
The 100Base-TX stream cipher function can be disabled by setting bit 9 = 1. The stream cipher function can be 
reenabled by writing a 0 to this bit.

Bypass MLT3 Encoder/Decoder (100Base-TX)
The 100Base-TX MLT3 encoder and decoder can be bypassed by setting bit 8 = 1. NRZ data is transmitted and 
received on the cable. The MLT3 encoder can be reenabled by clearing this bit.

Bypass Receive Symbol Alignment (100Base-TX)
100Base-TX receive symbol alignment can be bypassed by setting bit 7 = 1. When used in conjunction with the 
bypass 4B/5B encoder/decoder bit, unaligned 5B codes are placed directly on the RX_ER and RXD[3:0] pins. 

Reset Scrambler (100Base-TX)
When bit 6 is set = 1, the BCM50685 resets the scrambler to an all 1 state. This bit is self-clearing and always 
returns 0 when read.

Enable LED Traffic Mode
When bit 5 is set = 1, the BCM50685 enables the LED Traffic mode for ACTIVITY, RCVLED and XMITLED. When 
this bit is cleared, the BCM50685 disables the LED Traffic mode.

10Base-T TXC Invert Mode
When bit 11 of the 10Base-T register is set, the polarity of the 10Base-T transmit clock is inverted. Clearing this 
bit restores normal transmit clock polarity. This bit is valid only during 10Base-T operation. 

Jabber Disable
Setting bit 9 allows the user to disable the jabber detect function defined in the IEEE standard. When a 
transmission request has exceeded a maximum time limit, this function shuts off the transmitter. Clearing this 
bit or resetting the chip restores normal operation. Reading this bit returns the value of jabber detect disable. 
This bit is valid only during 10Base-T operation. 

10Base-T Echo Mode
When bit 6 is enabled during 10Base-T half-duplex transmit operation, the transmitted data is replicated on the 
receive data pins and the TXEN signal echoes on the RX_DV pin. The TXEN signal also echoes on the CRS pin 
and CRS deassertion directly follows the TXEN deassertion.

When in SGMII mode, the transmit and receive functions on the Copper Media Dependent Interface are 
disabled, the SGMII interface is in auto-negotiation mode, and link is established with the Switch if the Switch 
sends back an acknowledgement to the PHY. If the Switch does not send back an acknowledgement, the PHY 
remains in auto-negotiation mode. Any data received from the Switch is ignored, and no data is sent from the 
PHY to the Switch. Only auto-negotiation link code words pass between the PHY and the Switch because the 
PHY’s Copper MDI is disabled, and the PHY communicates to the Switch that there is no Copper link.

Shadow Register Read Selector
Bits[14:12] are written, regardless of the value of bit 15. These bits determine the shadow for an MII register 
18h read operation. 

See Table 44 and Table 45 on page 126 for information on reading from and writing to register 18h.

Packet Counter Mode
Bit 11 sets the packet counter mode in Expansion register 00h. If bit 11 = 1, it counts the number of receive 
packets. If bit 11 = 0, it counts the number of transmit packets.

Force Auto-MDIX Mode
Setting bit 9 = 1 enables Auto-MDIX mode while auto-negotiation is disabled. The default is to disable the Auto-
MDIX function when auto-negotiation is disabled.

Ethernet@Wirespeed Enable
When bit 4 = 1, Ethernet@Wirespeed mode is enabled. If the link cannot be established within two to nine 
attempts (the number of attempts is set by bits[4:2] in register 1Ch, shadow 04h), the BCM50685 downgrades 
its advertised abilities and again tries to establish a link. When bit 4 is cleared, the BCM50685 advertises its 
abilities according to registers 04h and 09h.

MDIO All PHY Select
When bit 3 = 1, a MDIO write operation with PHY Address = 00000 is accepted in addition to the real address 
of the PHY. By setting this bit to a 1 for all eight ports, a single write to PHY address 00000 writes all eight ports.

BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Auto-Negotiation Complete
When auto-negotiation is complete, the BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 15. This bit returns a 0 while auto-
negotiation is in progress.

Auto-Negotiation Complete Acknowledge
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 14 when the auto-negotiation state machine has entered the Link OK Check 
state since the last time this register was read; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Auto-Negotiation Acknowledge Detect
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 13 when the auto-negotiation state machine has entered the Acknowledge 
Detect state since the last time this register was read; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Auto-Negotiation Ability Detect
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 12 when the auto-negotiation state machine has entered the Ability Detect 
state since the last time this register was read; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Auto-Negotiation Next Page Wait
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 11 when the auto-negotiation state machine has entered the Next Page Wait 
state since the last time this register was read; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Auto-Negotiation HCD (Current Operating Speed and Duplex Mode)
Bits[10:8] report the mode of operation negotiated between the BCM50685 and its link partner. As reported 
by bit 15, these bits return 000 until auto-negotiation is completed. When the auto-negotiation function has 
been disabled, bits[10:8] report the manually selected mode of operation when register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 9  
= 0. If auto-negotiation is disabled and register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 9 = 1, then bits[10:8] = 000.

Parallel Detection Fault
When a parallel detection fault has occurred in the auto-negotiation state machine, bit 7 returns a 1. When a 
parallel detection fault occurs, this bit is latched to a 1 and remains so until the next register read. This bit 
returns a 0 when a parallel detection fault has not occurred since the last time it was read.

Remote Fault
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 6 when the link partner has detected a remote fault; otherwise, it returns a 0.

The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 5 when a new link code word has been received from the link partner since 
the last time this register was read; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Link Partner Auto-Negotiation Ability
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 4 of the when the link partner is known to have auto-negotiation capability. 
Before any auto-negotiation information is exchanged, or if the link partner does not comply with IEEE auto-
negotiation, the bit returns a 0.

Link Partner Next Page Ability
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 3 when the link partner needs to transmit Next Page information; otherwise, 
it returns a 0.

Link Status
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 2 when the link status is good; otherwise, it returns a 0. 

Pause Resolution—Receive Direction and Transmit Direction
When auto-negotiation has completed, the BCM50685 returns the result of the pause resolution function for 
full-duplex flow control on bits[1:0]. When bit 1 returns a 1, the link partner can send pause frames toward the 
local device. When bit 0 returns a 1, pause frames can be transmitted by the local device to the link partner. 
These bits are only guaranteed to be valid when bit 15 of the Auxiliary Status Summary register is 1.

The INTR pin is driven high when the BCM50685 detects energy on the twisted pair interface. Set the LED 
selector register to enable INTR LED mode (1Ch, shadow 0Dh and/or 0Eh set bits[7:4] and or bits[3:0] to 0110, 
depending upon the LED being used). When Energy is detected (bit 5 = 1 in register 1Ch, shadow 1Fh) the INTR 
pin is driven high.

Link Utilization LED Selector
Bits[1:0] apply to the LED programmed to the Activity mode only. When in ACTIVITY LED mode, the LED 
expresses an estimated activity in terms of blink rate. The blink rate of the LED increases as the activity duty 
cycle increases by increments of 10%. For duty cycles of 0.001% to10%, the LED blinks at 3 Hz; for duty cycles 
of 10% to 20%, the LED blinks at 6 Hz; and for duty cycles of 90% to 96%, the LED blinks at 30 Hz. Even though 
the frequency of the LED blink increases, the duty cycle of the LED stays at about 50%. The ACTIVITY LED can 
be programmed to display the following:

• 00 = Normal activity 
(fixed blink rate)

• 01 = Transmit activity 
with variable blink 
rate

• 10 = Receive activity

register. For reading the values of bits 9:0], perform an MDIO write with bit 15 cleared and preferred shadow 
values in bits[14:10]. The next MDIO read of register address 1Ch contains the preferred shadow register values 
in bits[9:0].

Shadow Register Selector
LED GPIO Control/Status register bits[14:10] must be set to 01111 to enable read/write to the register address 
1Ch.

Programmable LED I/O Control
Setting any of the bits[3:0] = 1 causes the corresponding LED pin(s) to disable the LED output(s). Clearing any 
of the bits[3:0] enables the corresponding LED output(s).

Bit 6 of this register determines whether the device is in IEEE-Compliant Link Drop Detection mode or in Fast 
Link Drop detection mode. By default the device is set to IEEE-Compliant mode. Enabling Fast Link Drop 
Detection will reduce the time the PHY takes to indicate a 1000Base-T link drop from 750 ms (IEEE standard) 
to less than 1ms. When Fast Link Drop Detection is enabled, the PHY is not compliant to IEEE 802.3 Clause 28.x

1000Base-X Registers 00h to 14hBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Reset
To reset the BCM50685 transceiver by software control, a 1 must be written to bit 15. This bit clears itself after 
the reset process is complete and does not need to be cleared using a second MII write. Writes to other register 
bits have no effect until the reset process is completed, which requires approximately 2.0 µs. Writing a 0 to this 
bit has no effect. A 1 is returned when this bit is read during the reset process; otherwise, it returns a 0.

SGMII-Slave Manual Speed[0]
Bit 13 is used in conjunction with bit 6 to manually set the speed of the SGMII interface when in SGMII to 
SGMII-Slave mode.

Auto-Negotiation Enable
When bit 12 = 1, the BCM50685 mode of operation is controlled by auto-negotiation. When this bit is cleared, 
the BCM50685 mode of operation is determined by the duplex mode.

Power Down
When bit 11 = 1, the fiber or SGMII-Slave interface is powered down. 

Restart Auto-Negotiation
Setting bit 9 = 1 forces the auto-negotiation process to be restarted, regardless of the current state of the auto-
negotiation state machine. 

Duplex Mode
When auto-negotiation is disabled, the duplex mode of the BCM50685 can be controlled by writing to bit 8. 
Setting bit 8 = 1 forces the BCM50685 into full-duplex operation, and clearing this bit forces the BCM50685 into 
half-duplex operation. When this bit is read, it returns the last value written. The default value of this bit is 
determined by the FDX pin at reset.

1000Base-X Registers 00h to 14hBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Auto-Negotiation Complete
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 5 when auto-negotiation has completed, and the contents of registers 04h, 
05h, and 06h are valid. This bit returns a 0 while auto-negotiation is in progress.

Remote Fault
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 4 when its link partner has signaled a remote fault condition. When a remote 
fault occurs, the bit is set = 1 and remains so until the remote fault condition has been cleared and the register 
is read.

Auto-Negotiation Ability
Even if the auto-negotiation function has been disabled, the BCM50685 is capable of performing IEEE auto-
negotiation and returns a 1 when bit 3 is read.

Link Status
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 2 when the link monitor is in the Link Pass state (indicating that a valid link 
has been established); otherwise, it returns a 0. When a link failure occurs, the Link Status bit is latched at 0 
and remains so until the bit is read and the BCM50685 is in the link pass state.

Jabber Detect
The jabber detect function is not supported for the 1000Base-X. This bit always returns a 0. 

Extended Capability
The BCM50685 supports extended capability registers, and returns a 1 when bit 0 of the 1000Base-X MII Status 
register is read.

Note: The preamble is still required on the first read or write. Preamble suppression cannot be disabled.

1000Base-X Registers 00h to 14hBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

PHY Identifier

The IEEE has issued an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to Broadcom Corporation. This 24-bit number 
allows devices made by Broadcom to be distinguished from all other manufacturers. The OUI combined with 
model numbers and revision numbers assigned by Broadcom precisely identifies a device manufactured by 
Broadcom.

Bits[15:0] of MII register 02h (PHYID HIGH) contain OUI bits[3:18]. Bits[15:0] of MII register 03h (PHYID LOW) 
contain the most significant OUI bits[19:24]: six manufacturer model number bits, and four revision number 
bits. The two least significant OUI binary bits are not used.

Broadcom Corporation's OUI is 00-10-18 (expressed as hexadecimal values). The binary OUI is 0000-0000-
0000-1000-0001-1000. The model number for the BCM50685 is 0Bh. Revision numbers start with 0h and 
increment by 1 for each chip modification.

QSGMII RegistersBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

The QSGMII registers operate under the IEEE 802.3 Clause 22 management access protocol (See “MII 
Management Interface Register Programming” on page 81 for more details). Table 118 shows the MII 
management frame format.

The Clause 22 management protocol addressing scheme has a limitation of 32 registers for each PHY Address. 
In order to overcome this limitation, the BCM50685 registers use 2 indirect address pointers to expand its 
register addressing space. The two indirect address pointers are described below:

1. Block Address 
Register (BAR) 
pointer: The QSGMII 
registers are 
organized into 4K 
blocks of register 
space. Each block has 
sixteen registers. 
Register address of 
0x1F in each block is 
reserved for the BAR 
pointer. The BAR 
pointer determines 
which block of 
register banks are 
used for the next 
read/write operation. 
 
The MII management 
frame format for 
setting the BAR 
pointer is shown 
below:

a. ST = 01 (Clause 22 
Frame)

b. OP = 01(MII write 
operation)

c. PHYAD = 
PHYAD[4:0] pins 
+8 (This is the 
QSGMII PHY 
address. See “PHY 

Address (PHYAD)” 
on page 81 for 
more details.)

d. REGAD = 0x1F 
(Register address 
where the BAR 
pointer resides)

e. Data[15:4] = BAR 
pointer (Block 
Address to be 
accessed)

f. Data[3:0] = Don’t 
care, set these bits 
= 0x0. (The lower 4 
bits of the data 
field are not used 
for the BAR 
pointer.)

2. Address Extension 
Register (AER) 
pointer: The AER 
pointer is used to 
determine which one 
of the 2 QSGMII ports 
(QSGMII[1] and 
QSGMII[2]) or which 
one of the 8 SGMII 
lanes (SGMII Lane 1 to 
SGMII Lane 8) are to 
be accessed. SGMII 
Lane 1 corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 1, 

SGMII lane 2 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 2, 
SGMII lane 3 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 3, 
SGMII lane 4 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 4, 
SGMII lane 5 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 5, 
SGMII lane 6 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 6, 
SGMII lane 7 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 7, 
and SGMII lane 8 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 8. 
The AER pointer takes 
two MDIO write 
operations to set its 
value. The first write 
operation sets the 
BAR pointer with 
value of 0xFFD. After 
this write operation 
the BAR pointer is set 
to the Block where 
the AER pointer 
resides. The second 

step is to write the 
register address and 
the content value for 
the AER.  
The MII management 
frame format for 
setting the BAR 
pointer is shown 
below:

a. ST = 01 (Clause 22 
Frame)

b. OP = 01(MII write 
operation)

c. PHYAD = 
PHYAD[4:0] pins 
+8 (This is the 
QSGMII PHY 
address. See “PHY 
Address (PHYAD)” 
on page 81 for 
more details.)

d. REGAD = 0x1E 
(Register address 
where the AER 
register resides)

e. Data[15:0] = AER 
Pointer. (Specify 
which QSGMII 
port or SGMII lane 
to be accessed) 
Table 119 shows 
which QSGMII

Note: 
• RESET must be low when power supplies are ramping up.
• When RESET is low, there must be a valid clock signal at the REFCLK input. All external power supplies need 

to be stable.
• MII register read/write access and normal PHY operation can start at the end of the RESET_WAIT tiP H�
• RESET_PU must be performed when the device is first powered up. Software reset or RESET_LEN does not 

need to be performed after RESET_PU.
• Software reset or RESET_LEN should not be performed until after RESET_PU and RESET_WAIT have been 

completed. After issuing a software reset or a RESET_LEN, normal PHY operation can begin after waiting 
the RESET_WAIT time of 20 µs.

• Software reset behaves the same as hardware reset (all hardware configuration pins are relatched).

Junction Temperature Estimation and PSIJT Versus ThetaJCBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Junction Temperature Estimation and PSIJT Versus ThetaJC
Package thermal characterization parameter Psi-JT (ΨJT) yields a better estimation of actual device junction 
temperature (TJ) versus using the junction-to-case thermal resistance parameter Theta-JC (θJC). The reason for 
this is, θJC assumes that all the power is dissipated through the top surface of the package case. In actual 
applications some of the power is dissipated through the bottom and sides of the package. ΨJT takes into 
account power dissipated through the top, bottom and sides of the package. The equation for calculating the 
device junction temperature is as follows: 

Where:

• TJ = junction 
temperature at 
steady-state 
condition, °C

• TT = package case top 
center temperature 
at steady-state 
condition, °C

• P = device power 
dissipation, Watts 
(4.32W for 
BCM50685)

• ΨJT = package 
thermal 
characteristics (no 
airflow), °C/W

Broadcom offers both a standard package and a RoHS package that is in compliance with RoHS and WEEE 
directives. Standard parts are also in compliance with these directives, with the exception of Pb (>1000ppm). 
Table 177 shows the main differences between standard and RoHS compliant parts.

RoHS compliant parts have a letter 'G' added to the top line of the part marking. Standard parts (non Pb-free 
parts) are NOT compatible to Pb-free surface mount process. See application note: PACKAGINGAN101-R for

Octal QSGMII to 10/100/1000Base-T or Fiber 
Transceiver

GENERAL DESCRIPTION FEATURES

The BCM50685 transceiver can support either eight 
QSGMII to copper (10/100/1000Base-T) or eight 
QSGMII to Fiber (100Base-FX, 1000Base-X, or SGMII-
Slave) interfaces. When in QSGMII to Copper mode 
the PHY performs all of the physical layer (PHY) 
functions for 1000Base-T, 100Base-TX, and 10Base-T 
on standard Category 5 UTP cable. When in QSGMII 
to Fiber mode the PHY performs all of the physical 
layer (PHY) functions for 100Base-FX, 1000Base-X 
and SGMII-Slave. The BCM50685 is designed to 
comply with the QSGMII industry standard and to 
exceed IEEE specifications for noise cancellation and 
transmission jitter, providing consistent and reliable 
operation over the broadest range of existing cable 
plants.

The BCM50685 is based on the proven digital-signal 
processor technology of Broadcom®, combining 
digital adaptive equalizers, ADCs, phase locked loops, 
line drivers, encoders, decoders, echo cancelers, 
crosstalk cancelers, and all other required support 
circuitry integrated into a single monolithic CMOS 
chip.

Designed for reliable operation over worst-case 
Category 5 cable plants, the BCM50685 
automatically negotiates with any transceiver on the 
opposite end of the wire to agree on an operating 
speed. The PHY can also evaluate the condition of the 
twisted-pair wiring to ensure that the wiring can 
support operation at Gigabit speeds, and detect and 
correct most common wiring problems. The device 
continually monitors both the wiring and the 
opposing transceiver and alerts the system if it 
detects potential problems with reliable operation.

Serial Gigabit Media Independent InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface
The BCM50685 can communicate with Ethernet devices that support Serial Gigabit Media Independent 
Interface (SGMII). The SGMII transmits serial data differentially at 1.25 gbaud via the SGOUT± pins, and 
receives serial data differentially via the SGIN± pins, which includes an on-chip, 100Ω differential termination 
resistor. In SGMII mode, serial output data is clocked on both edges of a differential 625 MHz clock via the 
SGIN± pins. Because the BCM50685 provides clock recovery on the SGMII input data, the input clock is not 
required.

Quad Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface
The BCM50685 can communicate with Ethernet MAC or Switch devices that support Quad Serial Gigabit Media 
Independent Interface (QSGMII). The QSGMII transmits serial data differentially at 5 gbaud via the QSGOUT± 
pins, and receives 5 gbaud serial data differentially via the QSGIN± pins, which includes an on-chip, 100Ω 
differential termination resistor. 

The BCM50685 supports two QSGMII ports. Each QSGMII port supports four PHYs.

Management Interface 
The BCM50685 contains a large set of management registers. The Status and control registers of the 
BCM50685 are accessible through the MDIO and MDC serial interface. The functional and electrical interface 
complies with IEEE Std 802.3, Section 22, and also supports MDC clock rates of up to 12.5 MHz. The 
management interface supports the defined Status and Control registers of IEEE Std 802.3, Clauses 22, 28, 37, 
and 40. In addition, the BCM50685 contains multipurpose registers for extended software control.

Encoder 
In 10Base-T mode, Manchester encoding is performed on the data stream that is transmitted on the twisted-
pair cable. The multimode transmit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) performs preequalization for 100m of 
Category 3 cabling.

In 100Base-TX mode, the BCM50685 transmits a continuous data stream over the twisted-pair cable. The 
transmit packet is encapsulated by replacing the first 2 nibbles of preamble with a start-of-stream delimiter (/
J/K codes) and appending an end-of-stream delimiter (/T/R codes) to the end of the packet. The transmitter 
repeatedly sends the idle code group between packets. The encoded data stream is serialized and then 
scrambled by the stream cipher block, as described in “Stream Cipher” on page 35. The scrambled data is then 
encoded into MLT3 signal levels.

ä

DecoderBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

In 1000Base-T mode, the BCM50685 simultaneously transmits and receives a continuous data stream on all 
four pairs of the Category 5 cable. Byte-wide data from the transmit data pins is scrambled when the transmit 
enable is asserted, and the trellis (a PAM5 symbol on each of the four twisted-pairs) is encoded into a four-
dimensional code group and then inserted into the transmit data stream. The transmit packet is encapsulated 
by replacing the first two bytes of the preamble with a start-of-stream delimiter, and appending an end-of-
stream delimiter to the end of the packet. When the transmit error input is asserted during a packet 
transmission, a transmit error code group is sent in place of the corresponding data code group. The 
transmitter sends idle code groups or carrier extend code groups between packets. Carrier extension is used 
by the Switch to separate packets within a multiple-packet burst, and is indicated by asserting the transmit 
error signal and placing 0Fh on the transmit data pins while the transmit enable is low. A carrier extend error 
is indicated by replacing the transmit data input with 1Fh during carrier extension.

The encoding complies with IEEE 802.3ab and is fully compatible with previous versions of the Broadcom 
1000Base-T PHYs.

Decoder 
In 10Base-T mode, Manchester decoding is performed on the data stream.

In 100Base-TX mode, following equalization and clock recovery, the receive data stream is converted from 
MLT3 to serial non-return to zero (NRZ) data. The NRZ data is descrambled by the stream cipher block, as 
described later in this document. The descrambled data is then deserialized and aligned into 5-bit code groups. 
The 5-bit code groups are decoded into 4-bit data nibbles. The start-of-stream delimiter is replaced with 
preamble nibbles, and the end-of-stream delimiter and idle codes are replaced with 0h. The decoded data is 
driven onto the MII receive data pins. When an invalid code group is detected in the data stream, the 
BCM50685 asserts the MII receive error (RX_ER) signal. RX_ER is also asserted when the link fails or when the 
descrambler loses lock during packet reception.

In 1000Base-T mode, the receive data stream is:

• Passed through the 
Viterbi decoder

• Descrambled • Translated back into 
byte-wide data

The start-of-stream delimiter is replaced with preamble bytes, and the end-of-stream delimiter and idle codes 
are replaced with 00h. Carrier extend codes are replaced with 0Fh or 1Fh. The decoded data is driven onto the 
QSGMII receive data pins. Decoding complies with IEEE 802.3ab and is fully compatible with previous versions 
of Broadcom 1000Base-T PHYs. 

Carrier Sense 
In SGMII mode, the carrier sense information is encoded into the control signals.

Link MonitorBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Link Monitor
In 10Base-T mode, a link-pulse detection circuit constantly monitors the TRD[0]{8:1}± and TRD[1]{8:1}± pins for 
the presence of valid link pulses.

In 100Base-TX mode, receive signal energy is detected by monitoring the receive pair for transitions in the 
signal level. Signal levels are qualified using squelch detect circuits. When no signal is detected on the receive 
pair, the link monitor enters the Link Fail state, and the transmission and reception of data packets are disabled. 
When a valid signal is detected on the receive pair for a minimum of 1 ms, the link monitor enters the Link Pass 
state, and the transmit and receive functions are enabled.

Following auto-negotiation in 1000Base-T mode, the master transceiver begins sending data on the media. The 
slave transceiver also begins transmitting when it has recovered the master transceiver’s timing. Each end of 
the link continuously monitors its local receiver status. When the local receiver status has been good for at least 
1 μs, the link monitor enters the Link Pass state, and the transmission and reception of data packets are 
enabled. When the local receiver status is bad for more than 750 ms, the link monitor enters the Link Fail state, 
and the transmission and reception of data packets are then disabled.

Digital Adaptive Equalizer
The digital adaptive equalizer removes intersymbol interference (ISI) created by the transmission channel 
media. The equalizer accepts sampled unequalized data from the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on each 
channel and produces equalized data. The BCM50685 achieves an optimum signal-to-noise ratio by using a 
combination of feed forward equalization (FFE) and decision feedback equalization (DFE) techniques. Under 
harsh noise environments, these powerful techniques achieve a bit error rate (BER) of less than 1 x 10-12 for 
transmissions of: up to 100m on Category 5 twisted-pair cabling for 1000Base-T and 100Base-TX mode; up to 
100m on Category 3 UTP cable for 10Base-T mode. The all-digital nature of the design makes the BCM50685 
very tolerant to noise. The filter coefficients are self-adapting to accommodate varying conditions of cable 
quality and cable length.

Echo Canceler
Because of the bidirectional nature of the channel in 1000Base-T modes, an echo impairment is caused by each 
transmitter. The output of the echo filter is added to the FFE output to remove the transmitted signal 
impairment from the incoming receive signal. The echo canceler coefficients are self-adapting to manage the 
varying echo impulse responses caused by different channels, transmitters, and environmental conditions.

Crosstalk CancelerBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Crosstalk Canceler
The BCM50685 transmits and receives a continuous data stream on four channels in gigabit mode. For a given 
channel, the signals sent by the other three local transmitters cause impairments on the received signal 
because of near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the pairs. It is possible to cancel the effect because each 
receiver has access to the data for the other three pairs that cause this interference. The output of the adaptive 
NEXT canceling filters is added to the FFE output to cancel the NEXT impairment.

Analog-to-Digital Converter
Each receive channel has its own 125 MHz analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that samples the incoming data 
on the receive channel and feeds the output to the digital adaptive equalizer. Advanced analog circuit 
techniques achieve the following results:

• Low offset • High-power supply 
noise rejection

• Fast settling time • Low bit error rate

Clock Recovery/Generator
The clock recovery and generator block creates the transmit and receive clocks for 1000Base-T, 100Base-TX, 
and 10Base-T operation. In 10Base-T or 100Base-TX mode, the transmit clock is locked to the 25 MHz crystal 
input, and the receive clock is locked to the incoming data stream.

In 1000Base-T mode, the two ends of the link perform loop timing. One end of the link is configured as the 
master, and the other is configured as the slave. The master transmit and receive clocks are locked to the 
25 MHz crystal input. The slave transmit and receive clocks are locked to the incoming receive data stream. 
Loop timing allows for the cancellation of echo and NEXT impairments by ensuring that the transmitter and 
receiver at each end of the link are operating at the same frequency.

Baseline Wander Correction
1000Base-T and 100Base-TX data streams are not always DC-balanced. Because the receive signal must pass 
through a transformer, the DC offset of the differential receive input can vary with data content. This effect, 
which is known as baseline wander, can greatly reduce the noise immunity of the receiver. The BCM50685 
automatically compensates for baseline wander by removing the DC offset from the input signal, thereby 
significantly reducing the probability of a receive symbol error.

In 10Base-T mode, baseline wander correction is not performed because the Manchester coding provides a 
perfect DC balance.

Multimode TX Digital-to-Analog ConverterBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Multimode TX Digital-to-Analog Converter
The multimode transmit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) transmits PAM5, MLT3, and Manchester coded 
symbols. The transmit DAC performs signal wave shaping that decreases the unwanted high frequency signal 
components, reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI). The transmit DAC uses a current drive output that 
is well-balanced, and therefore, produces very low-noise transmit signals.

Stream Cipher
In 1000Base-T and 100Base-TX modes, the transmit data stream is scrambled to reduce radiated emissions and 
to ensure that there are adequate transitions within the data stream. The 1000Base-T scrambler also ensures 
that there is no correlation among symbols on the four different wire pairs and in the transmit and receive data 
streams. The scrambler reduces peak emissions by randomly spreading the signal energy over the transmit 
frequency range and eliminating peaks at certain frequencies. The randomization of the data stream also 
assists the digital adaptive equalizers and echo/crosstalk cancelers. The algorithms in these circuits require that 
there be no sequential or cross-channel correlation among symbols in the various data streams.

In 100Base-TX mode, the transmit data stream is scrambled by exclusive ORing the encoded serial data stream. 
This is done with the output of an 11-bit wide linear feedback shift register (LFSR), producing a 2047-bit non-
repeating sequence.

In 1000Base-T mode, the transmit data stream is scrambled by exclusive ORing the input data byte with an 8-
bit wide cipher text word. The cipher text word generates each symbol period from eight uncorrelated maximal 
length data sequences that are produced by linear remapping of the output of a 33-bit wide LFSR. After the 
scrambled data bytes are encoded, the sign of each transmitted symbol is again randomized by a 4-bit wide 
cipher text word that is generated in the same manner as the 8-bit word. The master and slave transmitters 
use different scrambler sequences to generate the cipher text words. For repeater or switch applications, 
where all ports can transmit the same data simultaneously, signal energy is randomized further by using a 
unique seed to initialize the scrambler sequence for each PHY.

The receiver descrambles the incoming data stream by exclusive ORing it with the same sequence generated 
at the transmitter. The descrambler detects the state of the transmit LFSR by looking for a sequence 
representing consecutive idle code groups. The descrambler locks to the scrambler state after detecting a 
sufficient number of consecutive idle codes. The BCM50685 enables transmission and reception of packet data 
only when the descrambler is locked. The receiver continually monitors the input data stream to ensure that it 
has not lost synchronization by checking that inter-packet gaps containing idles or frame extensions are 
received at expected intervals. When the BCM50685 detects loss of synchronization, it notifies the link partner 
of the inability to receive packets (1000Base-T mode only) and attempts to resynchronize to the received data 
stream. If the descrambler is unable to resynchronize for a period of 750 ms, the BCM50685 is forced into the 
Link Fail state.

In 10Base-T mode, scrambling is not required to reduce radiated emissions.

Wire Map and Pair Skew CorrectionBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Wire Map and Pair Skew Correction
During 1000Base-T operation, the BCM50685 has the ability to automatically detect and correct some UTP 
cable wiring errors. The symbol decoder detects and compensates for (internal to the BCM50685) the following 
errors:

• Wiring errors caused 
by the swapping of 

pairs within the UTP 
cable

• Polarity errors caused 
by the swapping of 

wires within a pair

The BCM50685 also automatically compensates for differences in the arrival times of symbols on the four pairs 
of the UTP cable. The varying arrival times are caused by differing propagation delays (commonly referred to 
as delay skew) between the wire pairs. The BCM50685 can tolerate delay skews of up to 64 ns long. Auto-
negotiation must be enabled to take advantage of the wire map correction.

During 10/100 Mbps operation, pair swaps are corrected. Delay skew is not an issue though, because only one 
pair of wires is used in each direction.

Automatic MDI Crossover
During copper auto-negotiation, one end of the link needs to perform an MDI crossover so that each 
transceiver’s transmitter is connected to the other receiver. The BCM50685 can perform an automatic media 
dependent interface (MDI) crossover, eliminating the need for crossover cables or cross-wired (MDIX) ports. 
During auto-negotiation, the BCM50685 normally transmits on the TRD[0]{8:1}± pins and receives on the 
TRD[1]{8:1}± pins.

When connecting to another device that does not perform MDI crossover, the BCM50685 automatically 
switches its TRD[0]{8:1}± and TRD[1]{8:1}± pin pairs when necessary to communicate with the remote device. 
When connecting to another device that does have MDI crossover capability, an algorithm determines which 
end performs the crossover function.

The MDI Crossover State can be determined by reading register 11h, bit 13.

• 0 = Normal MDI mode • 1 = Crossover MDI mode

1000Base-T Operation
During 1000Base-T operation, the BCM50685 swaps the transmit symbols on pairs 0 and 1 and pairs 2 and 3 if 
auto-negotiation completes in the MDI crossover state. The 1000Base-T receiver automatically detects pair 
swaps on the receive inputs and aligns the symbols properly within the decoder. The automatic MDI crossover 
function can not be disabled when in 1000Base-T mode.

10/100Base-TX Operation (Auto-Negotiation Enabled)
During 10Base-T and 100Base-TX operation, pair swaps automatically occur within the device and do not 
require user intervention. The automatic MDI crossover function by default only works when auto-negotiation 
is enabled. This function can be disabled during auto-negotiation by writing to register 10h, bit 14 = 1.

Auto-NegotiationBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

10/100Base-TX Operation (Forced Mode)
The automatic MDI crossover function can also be enabled when in forced 10Base-T or forced 100Base-TX 
mode. This feature allows the user to disable the copper auto-negotiation in either 10Base-T or 100Base-TX 
and still take advantage of the automatic MDI crossover function. This feature is enabled by writing register 
18h, shadow 7h, bit 9 = 1.

When in forced 10Base-T or 100Base-TX mode the BCM50685 has a feature that can manually swap the MDI 
state when the automatic MDI crossover function is disabled. Normally the BCM50685 transmits on the 
TRD[0]{8:1}± pins and receives on the TRD[1]{8:1}± pins, but by setting register 1Eh, bit 7 = 1 the MDI state can 
be changed so that the BCM50685 transmits on the TRD[1]{8:1}± pins and receives on the TRD[0]{8:1}± pins. 

Auto-Negotiation

Copper Mode
The BCM50685, when configured for the copper mode, negotiates its mode of operation over the copper 
media using the auto-negotiation mechanism, defined in the IEEE 802.3u and 802.3ab specifications. When the 
auto-negotiation function is enabled, the BCM50685 automatically chooses the mode of operation by 
advertising its abilities and comparing them with those received from its link partner. The BCM50685 can be 
configured to advertise the following modes:

• 1000Base-T full-
duplex and/or half-

duplex

• 100Base-TX full-

duplex and/or half-
duplex

• 10Base-T full-duplex 
and/or half-duplex

The transceiver negotiates with its link partner and chooses the highest common operating speed and duplex 
mode, commonly referred to as highest common denominator (HCD). Auto-negotiation can be enabled or 
disabled by hardware and software control, but is always required for 1000Base-T operation. 

QSGMII Mode
When configured to QSGMII mode, the BCM50685 copper interface auto-negotiates based on Clauses 28 and 
40 of IEEE 802.3. The QSGMII auto-negotiates according to 1000Base-X auto-negotiation as described in IEEE 
802.3, Clause 37, except for a few changes to operate in QSGMII mode. The link timer is reduced to 1.6 ms, and 
the auto-negotiation code word is changed to reflect the copper link, copper duplex, and copper speed. 
QSGMII, based on the PHY port’s MDI negotiation, auto-negotiates per clause 37 in IEEE 802.3 with several 
modifications for QSGMII operation. More information is available in Cisco® document EDCS-540123 “QSGMII 
Specification.”

OT External Serial LED 3-State Output. Active High. These 32 pins 
output the data that is stored in the 32-bit storage register when the 
SLED_STRB pin is high.
The Serial LED outputs can be programmed to output 8-bits, 16-bits, 
24-bits, or 32-bits when the SLED_STRB pin is high.
Serial LED mode can only be entered through software. All Serial LED 
registers are accessed through Port 1’s registers. See “External Serial 
LED Interface” on page 72 for more details.

SLED_IN IPD, CS, D External Serial LED Input. Active-high. Serial LED data from the 
system.

SLED_OUT OD External Serial LED Out. Active High. Serial LED output that is used 
to daisy chain to the next BCM50685’s SLED_IN pin.

Serial LEDS
These pins are used when the BCM50685 is programmed to Serial LED (Expansion Register 71h, bit 13 = 1) or 
Low Cost Serial LED mode (Expansion Register 71h, bit 12 = 1).

SL_CLK OD Serial LED Clock Out. When in Serial LED mode this pin will output a 
clock running at approximately 3 MHz. This is used to clock out the 
SL_DO on the falling edge.
When in Low Cost Serial LED mode this pin will output a clock 
running at approximately 12.5 MHz. This is used to clock out the 
SL_DO on the falling edge.

SL_DO OD Serial LED Data Out. Active Low. This pin sources serial LED data 
output signal if Serial LED mode or Low Cost Serial LED mode is 
enabled. 

SL_FRAME OD Serial LED Frame. Active High. This pin sources the serial LED frame 
output signal if Serial LED mode is enabled.

 INTRPT OD Dedicated Interrupt Pin.  This pin indicates an interrupt occurred 
on one of the 8 ports of the PHY. Poll via MDIO the Interrupt Status 
Register (1Ah) to determine interrupt.

Operational DescriptionBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Section 5: Operational Description

Power Sequencing
It is recommended that the higher supply be brought up first (for example: 3.3V first, then 2.5V and then 1.2V) 
or at the same time as the lower supplies. This is only a recommendation and not a requirement. The 
BCM50685 does not have any specific power sequencing requirements. 

Resetting the BCM50685

Hardware Reset
The BCM50685 provides a hardware reset pin, RESET, which resets all internal nodes to a known state. 
Hardware reset is accomplished by holding the RESET pin low for at least 10 ms after the power supply voltages 
and clocks are stable. Once RESET is brought high, the PHY completes its reset sequence within 20 μs. All 
outputs are inactive until the PHY has completed its reset sequence. The PHY keeps the inputs inactive for 5 ms 
after the deassertion of hardware reset. The hardware configuration pins and the PHY address pins are read on 
the deassertion of hardware reset. 

Software Reset

The BCM50685 has two methods for performing software reset.

The first method reset all eight ports and behaves like hardware reset. Software reset will set all the PHY 
registers to the default values and hardware strap pins that are labelled sample on reset (SOR) are relatched. 
To enable the software reset, set bit 15 = 1 in register 00h. This bit is self-clearing. There is no effect if 0 is 
written to this bit.

The second method resets only the status registers but preserves all the MII registers that are writable. The 
strap options are not relatched. This reset is done on a port by port basis. To enable the software reset, set bit 
0 = 1 in Expansion Register 70h. This needs to be done to every port that needs resetting. This bit is self-
clearing. There is no effect if 0 is written to this bit.

Caution! The RESET pin must be asserted during power up.

Reference ClockBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Reference Clock
The BCM50685 can support a reference clock using the QREF_CLK± inputs at either 125 MHz or 156.25 MHz. 
There are two different reference clock schemes that can be used. Table 7 shows the two schemes.

Figure 7:  125 MHz or 156.25 MHz Differential QREF_CLKì � ,QSXW

125 MHz or 156.25 MHz QREF_CLK± Mode
Figure 7 shows a typical differential connection. When programmed into this mode the BCM50685 can use 
either a 125 MHz or a 156.25 MHz differential clock. The differential clock when using the QREF_CLK± inputs 
must be AC-coupled. There is no need for external termination on the inputs. The inputs have a differential 80Ω 
to 100Ω impedance integrated on-chip.

When 156.25MHz QREF_CLK± mode is selected, Expansion 55h bit 9 must be set to 1 for ports 2/8 and 6/8.

PHY AddressBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

PHY Address 
The BCM50685 has nine unique PHY addresses for MII management. Eight for PHY address pins and one for 
the QSGMII interface. PHY address for the ports are set to the following:

• Port 1 is set through 
the PHYA[4:0] pins

• Port 2 is the PHY 
address pins + 1

• Port 3 is the PHY 

address pins + 2

• Port 4 is the PHY 
address pins + 3

• Port 5 is the PHY 
address pins + 4

• Port 6 is the PHY 
address pins + 5

• Port 7 is the PHY 
address pins + 6

• Port 8 is the PHY 

address pins + 7

• QSGMII is the PHY 
address pins +8

The pins are latched at the trailing end of reset. A single MDC/MDIO bus can be used for multiple BCM50685 
devices. The PHY address pins must be strapped so that each octal device is at every eight addresses (X, X+8, 
X+16,..., X+32). Duplicate PHY addresses cannot exist in a single MDC/MDIO bus. There is a maximum of three 
BCM50685 devices per MDIO bus or 32 unique PHY addresses.

Every time an MII write or read operation is performed, the transceiver checks whether the PHY address in the 
instruction matches with its own PHY address definition. The operation is performed only when the addresses 
match. The PHY address of the port can only be set by hardware.

Super Isolate ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Super Isolate Mode
When in Super Isolate mode, the transmit and receive functions on the Copper Media Dependent Interface are 
disabled (No link is be established with the PHY’s copper link partner). A QSGMII link between the BCM50685 
and switch is established if the switch sends back an acknowledgement to the BCM50685 through the QSGMII 
auto-negotiation link code word. If the switch does not send back an acknowledgement, the PHY remains in 
auto-negotiation mode.

Hardware Enable
The BCM50685 has an additional hardware-strapping pin that can put the BCM50685 into Super Isolate mode 
right after a software or hardware reset. When Super Isolate mode is entered via the hardware-strapping pin, 
all eight ports are affected. To enable Super Isolate mode, pull the Super Isolate (SUPER_I) pin high at reset. 
The Super Isolate pin is sampled at reset and has an internal pull-down resistor. Super Isolate mode is disabled 
on a per-port basis. To disable Super Isolate mode, write to ”1000Base-T/100Base-TX/10Base-T Power/MII 
Control Register (Address 18h, Shadow 2h)” on page 131, bit 5 = 0 for each of the eight ports.

Software Enable
The BCM50685 can be put into Super Isolate mode on a per port basis by software. To enable Super Isolate 
mode, write to ”1000Base-T/100Base-TX/10Base-T Power/MII Control Register (Address 18h, Shadow 2h)” on 
page 131, bit 5 = 1 for each of the eight ports. To disable Super Isolate mode, write to ”1000Base-T/100Base-
TX/10Base-T Power/MII Control Register (Address 18h, Shadow 2h)” on page 131, bit 5 = 0 for each of the eight 
ports.

Standby Power-Down Mode 
The BCM50685 can be placed into standby Power-down mode using software commands. In this mode, all PHY 
functions, except for the serial management interface, are disabled. To enter standby Power-down mode, set 
MII Control register (Address 00h), bit 11 = 1. There are three ways to exit standby Power-down mode:

• Clear MII Control 
register (address 

00h), bit 11 = 0

• Set the software reset 

bit 15, MII Control 
register (address 00h)

• Assert the hardware 
RESET pin

Reads or writes to any MII register, other than MII Control register (address 00h) while the device is in the 
standby Power-down mode, returns unpredictable results. Upon exiting standby Power-down mode, the 
BCM50685 remains in an internal reset state for 40 µs, and then resumes normal operation.

Auto Power-Down ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Auto Power-Down Mode
The BCM50685 can be placed into an auto Power-down mode. Auto Power-down mode reduces chip power 
when the signal from the copper link partner is not present. The auto Power-down mode works whether the 
device is in auto-negotiation Enabled or Forced mode. This mode is enabled by setting bit 5 = 1 in “Auto Power-
Down Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 0Ah)”. When auto Power-down mode is enabled, the BCM50685 
automatically enters the Low-power mode when energy on the line is lost, and it resumes normal operation 
when energy is detected. When the BCM50685 is in Auto Power-down mode, it wakes up after 2.7s or 5.4s 
(determined by bit 4 in “Auto Power-Down Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 0Ah)”) and sends link pulses while 
monitoring for energy from the link partner. The BCM50685 enters normal operation and establishes a link if 
energy is detected, otherwise, the Wake-up mode continues for a duration of 84 ms to 1260 ms. This is 
determined by the timer bits[3:0] in “Auto Power-Down Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 0Ah)” before going 
back to Low-power mode.

SGMII PCS Loopback Mode
This mode allows the testing of the SGMII interface from the Link Partner. The receive packet from the Link 
Partner is sent to the SGIN± pins and passed through the PCS and sent back out the SGOUT± pins back to the 
MDI Link Partner. There is one mode supported when in SGMII PCS loopback mode.

• SGMII PCS loopback 
with RX data 

suppressed from the 
MDI and TX data 

suppressed to the 
MDI

The speed of the BCM50685’s SGMII interface and the speed of the Link Partner’s SGMII interface must match. 
The speed on the BCM50685’s MDI interface determines the speed of the BCM50685’s SGMII interface. There 
are two methods to set the BCM50685’s SGMII interface speed. The first method is by turning auto-negotiation 
off and forcing the MDI speed of the BCM50685. The second method is by linking up to a copper link partner 
either through auto-negotiation or through force mode. The following two sections describe how to set the

External Loopback ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

External Loopback Mode
The External Loopback mode allows in-circuit testing of the BCM50685, as well as the transmit path through 
the magnetics and the RJ-45 connector. External Loopback can be performed with and without a jumper block. 
External loopback using a jumper block tests the path through the magnetics and RJ45 connector. External 
loopback without the jumper block only tests the BCM50685’s transmit and receive circuitry. In 1000Base-T, 
100Base-TX, and 10Base-T modes, a jumper block must be inserted into the RJ-45 connector to support 
external loopback. The jumper block should have the following RJ-45 pins connected together:

1------------3

2------------6

4------------7

Table 8 through Table 13 on page 66 describe how the external loopback is enabled for 1000Base-T, 100Base-
TX, and 10Base-T modes with and without a jumper block.

Note: External loopback without a jumper does not work properly if there is a jumper block or cable 
connected to the RJ45 connector.

Full-Duplex ModeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Full-Duplex Mode 
The BCM50685 supports full-duplex operation. While in full-duplex mode, a transceiver can simultaneously 
transmit and receive packets on the cable.

Copper Mode
When auto-negotiation is disabled, full-duplex operation can be enabled by setting bit 8 of the “1000Base-T/
100Base-TX/10Base-T MII Control Register (Address 00h)”.

When auto-negotiation is enabled, the full-duplex capability is advertised for:

• 10Base-T; when bit 6 
in the “1000Base-T/
100Base-TX/10Base-T 
Auto-Negotiation 
Advertisement 

Register (Address 
04h)” is set.

• 100Base-TX; when bit 
8 in the “1000Base-T/
100Base-TX/10Base-T 

Auto-Negotiation 
Advertisement 
Register (Address 
04h)” is set.

• 1000Base-T; when bit 

9 in the “1000Base-T 
Control Register 
(Address 09h)” is set.

Ethernet@Wirespeed™
Ethernet@Wirespeed is an enhancement to Auto-negotiation that allows a network connection even over 
impaired cable plants. If a link can not be established at the highest common denominator within a 
programmable number of link attempts then the BCM50685 advertises the next highest advertised speed using 
auto-negotiation. Below is an example of how Ethernet@Wirespeed works.

At start-up the BCM50685 is advertising 1000Base-T, 100Base-TX, and 10Base-T capabilities per registers 04h 
and 09h and the Link Partner is also advertising the same capabilities:

• If a link cannot be 
established within a 
programmable 
number of link 
attempts (two to 
nine) with 1000Base-
T being advertised 
then an 
Ethernet@Wirespeed 
downgrade occurs, 
the 1000Base-T 
capability is masked 
out on the BCM50685 

and the next highest 
advertised capability 
(100Base-TX) is 
advertised.

• If a link cannot be 
established within a 
programmable 
number of link 
attempts (two to 
nine) with 100Base-
TX being advertised 
then an 
Ethernet@Wirespeed 

downgrade occurs, 
the 100Base-TX is 
masked out on the 
BCM50685 and the 
next highest 
advertised capability 
(10Base-T) is 
advertised.

• If a link can not be 
established within a 
programmable 
number of link 
attempts (two to 

nine) with 10Base-T 
being advertised then 
an 
Ethernet@Wirespeed 
downgrade occurs 
and all advertising 
capabilities are 
enabled (1000Base-T, 
100Base-TX, and 
10Base-T) on the 
BCM50685 and the 
whole process begins 
again.

Ethernet@Wirespeed™BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

The BCM50685 has a link up timer that times how long the link has been up. If the link stays up for at least 2.68 
seconds then the number of failed link attempts gets reset to zero and the BCM50685 advertises the highest 
speed when it tries to establish link. The purpose of the link-up timer is to prevent scenarios where the link 
never gets established at a lower speed because the link at the higher speed is unstable and is going up and 
down quickly. In this situation, if the link at the higher speed stays up for less than 2.68 seconds the number of 
link failed attempts gets incremented and the BCM50685 tries to establish link at a lower speed.

The link up timer can be bypassed by setting register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 10 = 1. Setting this bit causes the 
number of failed link attempts to get reset to zero after every link up condition, no matter how short the link 
up time is. 

In addition Ethernet@Wirespeed downgrade can be removed by any of the following events:

• Unplug cable (no 
energy) for 5.4 
seconds

• Hardware reset

• Software reset (reg. 
00h, bit 15 = 1)

• Disable auto-
negotiation (reg. 00h, 
bit 12 = 0)

• Restart auto-
negotiation (reg. 00h, 
bit 9 = 1)

• Disabling Wirespeed 

(reg. 18h, shadow 7h, 
bit 4 = 1)

• Autoneg resolves to 
no HCD (Highest 
Common 
Denominator)

• Programmable (2 to 

5) fails of the lowest 
supported speed 
wraps back to the 
original highest 
advertised speed.

Software Enable
Disabling Ethernet@Wirespeed is disabled on a per-port basis through software. To disable 
Ethernet@Wirespeed mode, write to register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 4 = 0 for each port to be disabled. 

Changing the Number of Failed Link Attempts before Ethernet@Wirespeed 
Downgrade
The number of failed link attempts before downgrading to a slower speed is programmable. The number can 
be programmed anywhere from two to nine failed link attempts before downgrading to a lower speed. The 
default value is five failed link attempts. The number of failed link attempts before downgrading to a lower 
speed can be programmed by writing to register 1Ch, shadow 4h, bits[4:2] as shown Table 14.

Note: The number of failed link attempts before downgrading to a slower speed is programmable. The 
number can be programmed anywhere from two to nine failed link attempts before downgrading to a 
lower speed. The default value is five failed link attempts. See “Changing the Number of Failed Link

Master/Slave Configuration 
In 1000Base-T mode, the BCM50685 and its link partner perform loop timing. One end of the link must be 
configured as the timing master and the other end as the slave. Master/slave configuration is performed by the 
auto-negotiation function. The auto-negotiation function first looks at the manual master/slave configuration 
bits advertised by the local PHY and the link partner. If neither PHY requests manual configuration, then the 
auto-negotiation function looks at the advertised repeater/DTE settings. If one PHY is advertised as a repeater 
port and the other is advertised as a DTE port, then the repeater port is configured as the master and the DTE 
port the slave. Each end generates an 11-bit random seed if the two settings are equal; the end with the higher 
seed is configured as the master. If the local PHY and the link partner generate the same random seed, then 
auto-negotiation is restarted.

If both ends of the link attempt to force the same manual configuration (both master or both slave), or the 
random seeds match seven consecutive times, then the BCM50685 sets the Master/Slave Configuration Fault 
bit in the 1000Base-T Status register and auto-negotiation is restarted. 

For setting the BCM50685 to manual master/slave configuration or to set the advertised repeater/DTE 
configuration, see “1000Base-T Control Register (Address 09h)”.

100 Number of failed link attempts before Ethernet@Wirespeed downgrade = 6

Next Page ExchangeBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Next Page Exchange 
The 1000Base-T configuration requires the exchange of three auto-negotiation next pages between the 
BCM50685 and its link partner. Exchange of 1000Base-T Next Page information takes place automatically when 
the BCM50685 is configured to advertise 1000Base-T capability.

The BCM50685 also supports software-controlled Next Page exchanges. When bit 15 of “1000Base-T/100Base-
TX/10Base-T Auto-Negotiation Advertisement Register (Address 04h)” is written to a 1, all Next Page 
transactions are controlled through the MII management interface. This includes the three 1000Base-T Next 
Pages, which are always sent first. The BCM50685 automatically generates the appropriate message code field 
for the 1000Base-T pages. When the BCM50685 is not configured to advertise 1000Base-T capability, the 
1000Base-T Next Pages are not sent.

When the BCM50685 is not configured to advertise 1000Base-T capability and bit 15 of the “1000Base-T/
100Base-TX/10Base-T Auto-Negotiation Advertisement Register (Address 04h)” is 0, the BCM50685 does not 
advertise Next Page ability.

SGMII or Fiber InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

SGMII or Fiber Interface
The SGMII interface uses two data signals to convey frame-data and link-rate information between the 
BCM50685 transceiver and a SGMII Master device or Fiber link partner. The data signals operate at 1.25 gbaud, 
and the clocks operate at a 625 MHz double data rate (DDR) interface. Each of these signals is realized as a 
differential pair because of the speed of operation, providing signal integrity while minimizing system noise. 
The SGMII signals use LVDS voltage levels. Both the data and clock signals are DC-balanced. However, because 
the SGMII interface operates off of 1.2V instead of 2.5V like in legacy SGMII/fiber applications, AC coupling with 
coupling capacitors is highly recommended.

The 1.25 gbaud transfer rate of the SGMII is greater than required for the BCM50685 transceiver operating at 
10 Mbps or 100 Mbps. When these situations occur, the BCM50685 elongates the frame by replicating each 
frame byte 10 times for 100 Mbps and 100 times for 10 Mbps. This frame elongation takes place above the 
802.3z PCS layer, making the start-frame delimiter appear only once per frame.

At the receive side, the BCM50685 transceiver passes the signals from the copper interface through the 
BCM50685 PCS layer. The BCM50685 serializes the PCS data to create a SGOUT± signal pair, and sends it to the 
Switch at a 1.25 Gbps data rate.

At the transmit side, the BCM50685 de-serializes the SGIN± signal pair to recover encoded parallel data. The 
BCM50685 passes parallel data through the PCS receive state machine to recover the transmit signals. The 
decoded transmit signals are passed through the transmit block and output to the BCM50685 copper port with 
a predetermined speed.

Control Information Exchanged Between Links
When configured for SGMII mode as SGMII Master, it is necessary for the BCM50685 to pass control 
information to the switch to notify the change of the link status. The SGMII interface uses the auto-negotiation 
block to pass control information. If the BCM50685 detects the link change, it starts its auto-negotiation 
process, sending out the updated control information. The receive block in the Switch receives and decodes 
control information and starts the auto-negotiation process. The transmit block in the Switch acknowledges 
the update of the link status. Upon receiving the acknowledgement from the Switch, the BCM50685 completes 
the auto-negotiation process and returns to the normal data mode.

LED InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Configuring the PHY for Fiber Mode
By default, the PHY is configured for QSGMII to copper mode (copper is selected when no medium is active) 
with auto-detect medium enabled (1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 0=1). This allows the link-up of either copper MDI or 
fiber MDI, with fiber MDI preferred, if both interfaces are active. SD must be inverted by setting 1Ch shadow 
1Eh bit 7=0.

1000Base-X MII registers are selected by setting 1Ch shadow 1Fh.0=1.

To place the part into fiber-only mode:

Set 1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 2=1 to select fiber as the only active MDI media. Set 1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 0=0 to turn 
off auto-detection between copper and fiber media.

LED Interface
There are four basic LED modes that the BCM50685 supports.The four modes are:

• Parallel LED Mode • External Serial LED 
Mode

• Serial LED Mode • Low Cost Serial LED 
Mode

Parallel LED Mode
The BCM50685 has eight programmable LED pins per port that perform different functions. Each of the 
BCM50685 LEDs can be individually programmed to any one of the many LED modes on a per-port basis. The 
available LED modes are:

• LINKSPD1

• LINKSPD2

• XMITLED 

• ACTIVITY

• FDXLED

• SLAVE

• INTR

• QUALITY

• RCVLED

• WIRESPEED 
DOWNGRADE

• MULTICOLOR[1]

• MULTICOLOR[2]

• CABLE DIAG (Open/
Short found)

• SGMII RECEIVING CRS

• ON

• OFF

Any LED programmed for the above modes, except for INTR LED, behaves as an active low push-pull outputs. 
Any LED programmed to INTR behaves as an active low open-drain output.

External Serial LED Interface
External Serial LED mode provides a means for system vendors to control the BCM50685’s LED behavior 
directly by providing a LED serial stream to the BCM50685. This LED stream is strobed into and out of the chip 
with a serial clock that may run up to 25 MHz. A strobe signal is provided to asynchronously shift data from the 
serializer to the LED output buffers on a rising edge. Figure 1 shows the Serial LED block diagram. Table 2 shows 
the External Serial LED hardware balls and Table 3 shows the software bits used for External Serial LED mode. 
The External Serial LEDs (SLED[1:32]) are mapped to the PHY’s Port LEDs as shown in Table TBD. Even though 
the Serial LEDs (SLED[1:31]) are mapped to the physical Port 1 to Port 8 leds, the incoming serial stream does 
not have to be mapped to the Port 1 to Port 8 leds. The customer determines the serial stream specifics.

Serial LED Mode
Serial LED mode requires the use of external serial-to-parallel shift registers such as multiple 74HC594 devices. 
This mode is based on a serial data stream (SL_DO), a serial data clock (SL_CLK) and a framing signal 
(SL_FRAME) use for latching the serial data through the parallel registers within the external devices. 

• SL_DO is an active 
low bit stream 
containing 48 bits per 
frame.

• SL_CLK runs at 
approximately 3 MHz 
and is used to clock 
out SL_DO on the 

falling edge.

• SL_Frame is an active 
high pulse that occurs 
once every 48 SL_DO 

bit times. The 
SL_FRAME goes high 
coincident with bit 0 
of port 1.

The 48 bit SL_DO output stream will output PORT1 bit(1) first and PORT8 bit(6) last. See sequence below.

Enabling Serial LED Mode
Serial LED mode can be enabled by setting bit 13 = 1 in Expansion Register 71h. Expansion Registers 71h and 
72h allow bits[6:1] can be programmed for the following modes: 

• LINKSPD1

• LINKSPD2

• XMITLED 

• ACTIVITY

• FDXLED

• SLAVE

• INTR

• QUALITY

• RCVLED

• WIRESPEED 
DOWNGRADE

• CABLE DIAG (Open/

Short found)

• SGMII RECEIVING CRS

• ON

• OFF

Low Cost Serial LED Mode 
Low Cost Serial LED mode is a simplified version that does not require a framing pulse for port data delineation. 
The mode requires the use of inexpensive shift registers such as multiple 74HC164 devices. The mode is based 
on a serial data stream (SL_DO) and a serial data clock (SL_CLK).

• SL_DO is an active 
low bit stream 
containing 48 bits per 
frame.The data is 
shifted so the 

updated of LEDs using 
a shift register that 
drives the display 
LEDs does not cause a 
noticeable flicker in 

normal operation. 

• SL_CLK runs at 
approximately 12.5 
MHz and is used to 
clock out SL_DO on 

the falling edge. The 
48 LED signals will get 
shifted out within a 
3.84us burst.

The 48 bit SL_DO output stream will output PORT1 bit(1) first and PORT8 bit(6) last. See sequence below.

Temperature Monitor
The BCM50685 uses an integrated temperature sensor to monitor the device temperature. The measurement 
relies on the characteristics of a semiconductor junction to calculate temperature. The analog sensing signal is 
preprocessed by signal conditioning circuitry, and it is then digitized by an ADC. Its value is stored in the local 
temperature data register (Expansion register 0Bh of port 4). When the measured temperature exceeds the 
respective threshold level, the temperature monitoring unit can generate an interrupt signal, and the event 
sets Expansion register 0Bh of port 4 bit 0. The interrupt signal can be masked by setting the Top Level MII Temp 
Monitor register offset 16h bit 7.

To enable the temperature monitoring function, set bit 5 of Top Level MII Temp Monitor register offset 16h to 
0 and Top Level 01h Bit 0 to 1. 

After powering-up the thermal monitoring function, the unit requires a 1.2 ms wait time before thermal data 
is converged. Thereafter, the thermal value is updated every 400 μs.

The BCM50685 measured temperature (Tm) value can be calculated using the following equation:

Tm = 267.75  –  0.7 x 
Temp Code,

where measured 
temperature (Tm) is 

in Celsius. 

The Temp Code value is a decimal in this equation. The temp code value can be read from 
Table 104: “Expansion Register 0Bh: Temperature Monitor PHYA[4:0]+3,” on page 217, bits 15:7. This value is 
in hexadecimal and it must be converted into the decimal for this equation.

Broadcom Serial Control (BSC) InterfaceBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Broadcom Serial Control (BSC) Interface
The BCM50685’s registers can be programmed through an external EEPROM through the BCM50685’s BSC 
interface. The BSC interface is compatible with the Phillips® I2C interface.This feature is useful in unmanaged 
systems.

The BCM50685’s BSC interface is a two wire Serial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA) open collector interface. 
Devices connected to it are classified as either master or slave. Although BSC protocol supports multiple master 
designs, the interface described by this document is a single master implementation. Serial EEPROMs and 
ROMs are considered slave devices. The SCL pin is driven by the master only. The SDA is bi-directional. The 
interface signaling can be categorized into a few simple functions. Start, Stop, Transmit and Receive. 

A transaction is initiated with a "Start". Start is defined by SDA going from high to low while SCL is high. The 
master then begins clocking out a byte that contains a 4 bit device code, a 3 bit select address and a R/W bit. 
All BSC memories use the device code "1010". During normal data transmission, data is only allowed to 
transition during the low period of SCL. If a device that recognizes the device code is listening on the bus, it 
acknowledges on the ninth clock by pulling SDA low.

A random access transaction always begins with a "write" operation to set the beginning address. This is 
accomplished by transmitting a '0' in the LS Bit of the device code byte. After the device code write (DCW) is 
acknowledged by the memory, the master clocks out one or two more bytes depending upon the size of the 
PROM/ROM. This is the starting address. A memory with more than 256 bytes will require two bytes of address, 
256 and less only one. If the desired transaction is a write, the master can simply continue writing until it is 
finished or the memory's buffer is full. 

Following every 8 bits of data, the master relinquishes the SDA line and the slave drives it low to acknowledge 
the receipt of the byte. When the master has completed the write, it issues a stop. Stop is defined as a low to 
high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. If the transaction is a read, after the address is written, another 
start is issued and the device code is sent with the LS Bit high (DCR). After the slave acknowledges the device 
code, it begins transmitting one bit of data per clock. Data is valid during the high period of the clock. After 8 
bits have been read, the master issues an ack. Upon receipt, the slave automatically increments it's internal 
address and begins transfer of the next byte. Reading continues until the master issues a nack at the end of a 
byte, or a start or stop is issued. The internal address register of the memory always points one address past 
the last byte accessed by a read or write operation.

Register SummaryBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Section 6: Register Summary

MII Management Interface Register Programming
The BCM50685 transceiver is fully compliant with the MII clause of the IEEE 802.3u Ethernet specification. The 
MII management interface registers are written and read serially, using the MDIO and MDC pins. A clock of up 
to 12.5 MHz must drive the MDC pin of the BCM50685. Data transferred to and from the MDIO0 and MDIO1 
pins is synchronized with the MDC0 and MDC1 clocks, respectively. The following section lists the components 
in each MII read or write instruction.

Preamble (PRE)
To signal the beginning of an MII instruction after reset, at least 32 consecutive 1 bits must be written to the 
MDIO pin of the BCM50685. A preamble of thirty-two 1 bits is required only for the first read or write following 
reset. If bit 6 of MII register 01h is cleared, a preamble is always required. A preamble of fewer than thirty-two 
1 bits causes the remainder of the instruction to be ignored.

Start of Frame (ST)
A 01 pattern indicates the start of the instruction follows.

Operation Code (OP)
A read instruction is indicated by 10, while a write instruction is indicated by 01.

PHY Address (PHYAD)
A 5-bit PHY address follows, with the MSB transmitted first. The PHY address allows a single MDIO bus to access 
multiple PHY chips.

Register Address (REGAD)
A 5-bit register address follows, with the MSB transmitted first. The addresses for the registers used by the 
BCM50685 are shown in Table 20 on page 83.

Turnaround (TA)
The next bit times are used to avoid contention on the MDIO pin when a read operation is performed. When a 
write operation is being performed, 10 must be sent to the BCM50685 chip during these 2 bit times. When a 
read operation is being performed, the MDIO pin of the Switch must be put in a high-impedance state during 
these bit times. The BCM50685 transceiver drives the MDIO pin to 0 during the second bit time.

MII Management Interface Register ProgrammingBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Data
The last 16 bits of the Instruction are the actual data bits. During a write operation, these bits are written to 
the MDIO pin with the most significant bit (MSB) transmitted first. During a read operation, the data bits are 
driven by the BCM50685 with the MSB transmitted first.

Table 19 summarizes the complete management frame format.

When writing to the MDIO pin, the bit value must be stable for 10 nanoseconds before the rising edge of the 
MDC, and must be held valid for 10 nanoseconds after the rising edge of the MDC. When reading from the 
MDIO pin, the data bit is valid at the rising edge of the MDC until the next falling edge of the MDC.

Example: To put a 
PHY with address 
00001 into Loopback 
mode, issue the 
following write MII 
instruction: 

1111 1111 1111 1111 
1111 1111 1111 
1111    0101 00001 
00000 10 0100 0000 
0000 0000

To determine if a PHY 

is in the link pass 
state, issue the 
following read MII 
instruction: 
1111 1111 1111 1111 
1111 1111 1111 

1111    0110 00001 
00001 ZZ ZZZZ ZZZZ 
ZZZZ ZZZZ

The BCM50685 drives the MDIO line during the last 17 bit times. If the link status is good, the third bit from the 
end (bit 2) is 1.

1000Base-T/100Base-TX/10Base-T MII Control
This register is enabled by writing to:

• “Mode Control Register (Address 1Ch, Shadow 1Fh)” bit 0 = 0.

Reset
To reset the BCM50685 by software control, a 1 must be written to bit 15 of the MII Control register. This bit 
clears itself after the reset process is complete, and does not need to be cleared using a second MII write. 
Writes to other MII Control register bits have no effect until the reset process is completed, which requires 
approximately 2.0 µs. Writing a 0 to this bit has no effect. A 1 is returned when this bit is read during the reset 
process; otherwise, it returns a 0.

BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Internal Loopback
When enabled packets received on the SGIN± pins will be loopback out the SGOUT± pins. 

Speed Selection (LSB)
When auto-negotiation is disabled, bits 6 and 13 of the MII Control register can be used to manually select the 
speed of operation. When bit 6 is set and bit 13 is cleared, 1000Base-T operation is selected. When bit 6 is 
cleared and bit 13 is set, 100Base-TX operation is selected. When both bits are cleared, 10Base-T operation is 
selected. Setting both bits is not permitted. When read, these bits return the last value written. The default 
value for bit 13 is determined by the state of the SPD0 and F1000 pins at reset. 

Copper Auto-Negotiation Enable
When bit 12 of the MII Control register is set, the BCM50685 mode of operation is controlled by auto-
negotiation. When this bit is cleared, the BCM50685 mode of operation is determined by the Manual Speed, 
Duplex mode, and Master/Slave Configuration bits. A 1 is returned when this bit is read with auto-negotiation 
enabled; otherwise, it returns a 0. The default value of this bit is determined by the state of the ANEN pin at 
reset. 

Power-Down
When bit 11 of the MII Control register is set, the BCM50685 is placed into low-power standby mode. When in 
this mode all BCM50685 functions except for the MDIO/MDC, 1000Base-X and SGMII interfaces.

Restart Auto-Negotiation
Setting bit 9 of the MII Control register forces the auto-negotiation process to be restarted, regardless of the 
current state of the auto-negotiation state machine. When auto-negotiation is enabled, setting this bit restarts 
the auto-negotiation process. Clearing this bit has no effect. This bit is self-clearing. After the auto-negotiation 
process has restarted, it returns a value of 0.

Duplex Mode
When auto-negotiation is disabled, the duplex mode of the BCM50685 can be controlled by writing to bit 8 of 
the MII Control register. Setting this bit forces the BCM50685 into full-duplex operation, and clearing this bit 
forces the BCM50685 into half-duplex operation. The default value of this bit is determined by the FDX pin at 
reset.

The IEEE has issued an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to Broadcom Corporation. This 24-bit number 
allows devices made by Broadcom to be distinguished from all other manufacturers. The OUI combined with 
model numbers and revision numbers assigned by Broadcom precisely identifies a device manufactured by 
Broadcom.

Bits[15:0] of MII register 02h (PHYID HIGH) contain OUI bits[3:18]. Bits[15:0] of MII register 03h (PHYID LOW) 
contain the most significant OUI bits[19:24]: six manufacturer model number bits, and four revision number 
bits. The two least significant OUI binary bits are not used.

Broadcom Corporation's OUI is 00-10-18 (expressed as hexadecimal values). The binary OUI is 0000-0000-
0000-1000-0001-1000. The model number for the BCM50685 is 0Bh. Revision numbers start with 0h and

00h to 14h

BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Master/Slave Configuration Fault
When a master/slave configuration fault occurs during auto-negotiation, the BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 15. 
When a configuration fault occurs, the bit is latched at 1 and remains so until either the register is read, auto-
negotiation is restarted by writing bit 9 in the MII Control register, or auto-negotiation completes successfully 
with no master/slave configuration fault.

Master/Slave Configuration Resolution
When the BCM50685 transceiver has been configured as the master, it returns a 1 in bit 14. When the 
BCM50685 transceiver has been configured as the slave, it returns a 0.

Local Receiver Status
The BCM50685 transceiver returns a 1 in bit 13 when the local receiver status is good; otherwise, it returns a 0.

Remote Receiver Status
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 12 when the remote receiver status is good; otherwise, it returns a 0.

1000Base-T Full-Duplex Capability
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 11 when the link partner has advertised 1000Base-T full-duplex capability; 
otherwise, it returns a 0.

1000Base-T Half-Duplex Capability
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 10 when the link partner has advertised 1000Base-T half-duplex capability; 
otherwise, it returns a 0.

Idle Error Count
The BCM50685 counts the number of idle errors received while the local receiver status is good. Bits 7 through 
0 return the number of idle errors counted since the last time the register was read. The counter freezes at the 
maximum value (FFh) to prevent overflow.

Note: As indicated by bit 5 of the MII Status register (0h), the values contained in bits 14, 11, and 10 of 
the 1000Base-T Status register are guaranteed to be valid only after auto-negotiation has successfully 
completed.

BCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Transmit Disable
The transmitter can be disabled by setting bit 13 = 1. The copper transmitter outputs are forced into a high 
impedance state. 

Interrupt Disable
When this bit is set = 1, the INTR LED pin is forced to its inactive state.

Force Interrupt
When this bit is set = 1, the INTR LED pin is forced to its active state.

Bypass 4B/5B Encoder/Decoder (100Base-TX)
The 100Base-TX4B/5B encoder/decoder can be bypassed by setting bit 10 = 1. The transmitter sends 5B codes 
from the TX_ER and TXD[3:0] pins directly to the scrambler. TX_EN is ignored and frame encapsulation 
(insertion of J/K and T/R codes) is not performed. The receiver places descrambled and aligned 5B codes onto 
the RX_ER and RXD[3:0] pins. CRS is still asserted when a valid frame is received.

Bypass Scrambler/Descrambler (100Base-TX)
The 100Base-TX stream cipher function can be disabled by setting bit 9 = 1. The stream cipher function can be 
reenabled by writing a 0 to this bit.

Bypass MLT3 Encoder/Decoder (100Base-TX)
The 100Base-TX MLT3 encoder and decoder can be bypassed by setting bit 8 = 1. NRZ data is transmitted and 
received on the cable. The MLT3 encoder can be reenabled by clearing this bit.

Bypass Receive Symbol Alignment (100Base-TX)
100Base-TX receive symbol alignment can be bypassed by setting bit 7 = 1. When used in conjunction with the 
bypass 4B/5B encoder/decoder bit, unaligned 5B codes are placed directly on the RX_ER and RXD[3:0] pins. 

Reset Scrambler (100Base-TX)
When bit 6 is set = 1, the BCM50685 resets the scrambler to an all 1 state. This bit is self-clearing and always 
returns 0 when read.

Enable LED Traffic Mode
When bit 5 is set = 1, the BCM50685 enables the LED Traffic mode for ACTIVITY, RCVLED and XMITLED. When 
this bit is cleared, the BCM50685 disables the LED Traffic mode.

When an analog input polarity error has been detected and corrected, bit 13 returns a 1. This bit is valid only 
during 10Base-T operation. 

Block RX_DV Extension (IPG)
When bit 12 of the 10Base-T register is set, blocking of the RX_DV signal is extended for an additional four RXC 
cycles to extend the IPG.

10Base-T TXC Invert Mode
When bit 11 of the 10Base-T register is set, the polarity of the 10Base-T transmit clock is inverted. Clearing this 
bit restores normal transmit clock polarity. This bit is valid only during 10Base-T operation. 

Jabber Disable
Setting bit 9 allows the user to disable the jabber detect function defined in the IEEE standard. When a 
transmission request has exceeded a maximum time limit, this function shuts off the transmitter. Clearing this 
bit or resetting the chip restores normal operation. Reading this bit returns the value of jabber detect disable. 
This bit is valid only during 10Base-T operation. 

10Base-T Echo Mode
When bit 6 is enabled during 10Base-T half-duplex transmit operation, the transmitted data is replicated on the 
receive data pins and the TXEN signal echoes on the RX_DV pin. The TXEN signal also echoes on the CRS pin 
and CRS deassertion directly follows the TXEN deassertion. 

SQE Enable Mode
Setting bit 5 of the 10Base-T register enables SQE mode. Clearing disables it. This bit is valid only during 10Base-
T operation.

10Base-T No Dribble

When in SGMII mode, the transmit and receive functions on the Copper Media Dependent Interface are 
disabled, the SGMII interface is in auto-negotiation mode, and link is established with the Switch if the Switch 
sends back an acknowledgement to the PHY. If the Switch does not send back an acknowledgement, the PHY 
remains in auto-negotiation mode. Any data received from the Switch is ignored, and no data is sent from the 
PHY to the Switch. Only auto-negotiation link code words pass between the PHY and the Switch because the 
PHY’s Copper MDI is disabled, and the PHY communicates to the Switch that there is no Copper link.

Bits[14:12] are written, regardless of the value of bit 15. These bits determine the shadow for an MII register 
18h read operation. 

See Table 44 and Table 45 on page 126 for information on reading from and writing to register 18h.

Bit 11 sets the packet counter mode in Expansion register 00h. If bit 11 = 1, it counts the number of receive 
packets. If bit 11 = 0, it counts the number of transmit packets.

Force Auto-MDIX Mode
Setting bit 9 = 1 enables Auto-MDIX mode while auto-negotiation is disabled. The default is to disable the Auto-
MDIX function when auto-negotiation is disabled.

Ethernet@Wirespeed Enable
When bit 4 = 1, Ethernet@Wirespeed mode is enabled. If the link cannot be established within two to nine 
attempts (the number of attempts is set by bits[4:2] in register 1Ch, shadow 04h), the BCM50685 downgrades 
its advertised abilities and again tries to establish a link. When bit 4 is cleared, the BCM50685 advertises its 
abilities according to registers 04h and 09h.

MDIO All PHY Select
When bit 3 = 1, a MDIO write operation with PHY Address = 00000 is accepted in addition to the real address 
of the PHY. By setting this bit to a 1 for all eight ports, a single write to PHY address 00000 writes all eight ports.

= 0. If auto-negotiation is disabled and register 18h, shadow 7h, bit 9 = 1, then bits[10:8] = 000.

Parallel Detection Fault
When a parallel detection fault has occurred in the auto-negotiation state machine, bit 7 returns a 1. When a 
parallel detection fault occurs, this bit is latched to a 1 and remains so until the next register read. This bit 
returns a 0 when a parallel detection fault has not occurred since the last time it was read.

Remote Fault
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 6 when the link partner has detected a remote fault; otherwise, it returns a 0.

The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 2 when the link status is good; otherwise, it returns a 0. 

Pause Resolution—Receive Direction and Transmit Direction
When auto-negotiation has completed, the BCM50685 returns the result of the pause resolution function for 
full-duplex flow control on bits[1:0]. When bit 1 returns a 1, the link partner can send pause frames toward the 
local device. When bit 0 returns a 1, pause frames can be transmitted by the local device to the link partner. 
These bits are only guaranteed to be valid when bit 15 of the Auxiliary Status Summary register is 1.

Setting bit 2 =1 drives Remote Fault on the QUALITY LED. A Remote Fault condition is detected by the 
BCM50685 when bit 13 in Register 05h is set to a 1 during the auto-negotiation process 

Link Utilization LED Selector
Bits[1:0] apply to the LED programmed to the Activity mode only. When in ACTIVITY LED mode, the LED 
expresses an estimated activity in terms of blink rate. The blink rate of the LED increases as the activity duty 
cycle increases by increments of 10%. For duty cycles of 0.001% to10%, the LED blinks at 3 Hz; for duty cycles 
of 10% to 20%, the LED blinks at 6 Hz; and for duty cycles of 90% to 96%, the LED blinks at 30 Hz. Even though 
the frequency of the LED blink increases, the duty cycle of the LED stays at about 50%. The ACTIVITY LED can 
be programmed to display the following:

• 00 = Normal activity 
(fixed blink rate)

• 01 = Transmit activity 
with variable blink 
rate

• 10 = Receive activity 
with variable blink

1000Base-X Registers 00h to 14hBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Reset
To reset the BCM50685 transceiver by software control, a 1 must be written to bit 15. This bit clears itself after 
the reset process is complete and does not need to be cleared using a second MII write. Writes to other register 
bits have no effect until the reset process is completed, which requires approximately 2.0 µs. Writing a 0 to this 
bit has no effect. A 1 is returned when this bit is read during the reset process; otherwise, it returns a 0.

SGMII-Slave Manual Speed[0]
Bit 13 is used in conjunction with bit 6 to manually set the speed of the SGMII interface when in SGMII to 
SGMII-Slave mode.

Auto-Negotiation Enable
When bit 12 = 1, the BCM50685 mode of operation is controlled by auto-negotiation. When this bit is cleared, 
the BCM50685 mode of operation is determined by the duplex mode.

Power Down
When bit 11 = 1, the fiber or SGMII-Slave interface is powered down. 

Restart Auto-Negotiation
Setting bit 9 = 1 forces the auto-negotiation process to be restarted, regardless of the current state of the auto-
negotiation state machine. 

Duplex Mode
When auto-negotiation is disabled, the duplex mode of the BCM50685 can be controlled by writing to bit 8. 
Setting bit 8 = 1 forces the BCM50685 into full-duplex operation, and clearing this bit forces the BCM50685 into 
half-duplex operation. When this bit is read, it returns the last value written. The default value of this bit is 
determined by the FDX pin at reset.

Auto-Negotiation Complete
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 5 when auto-negotiation has completed, and the contents of registers 04h, 
05h, and 06h are valid. This bit returns a 0 while auto-negotiation is in progress.

Remote Fault
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 4 when its link partner has signaled a remote fault condition. When a remote 
fault occurs, the bit is set = 1 and remains so until the remote fault condition has been cleared and the register 
is read.

Auto-Negotiation Ability
Even if the auto-negotiation function has been disabled, the BCM50685 is capable of performing IEEE auto-
negotiation and returns a 1 when bit 3 is read.

Link Status
The BCM50685 returns a 1 in bit 2 when the link monitor is in the Link Pass state (indicating that a valid link 
has been established); otherwise, it returns a 0. When a link failure occurs, the Link Status bit is latched at 0 
and remains so until the bit is read and the BCM50685 is in the link pass state.

Jabber Detect
The jabber detect function is not supported for the 1000Base-X. This bit always returns a 0.

PHY Identifier

The IEEE has issued an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to Broadcom Corporation. This 24-bit number 
allows devices made by Broadcom to be distinguished from all other manufacturers. The OUI combined with 
model numbers and revision numbers assigned by Broadcom precisely identifies a device manufactured by 
Broadcom.

Bits[15:0] of MII register 02h (PHYID HIGH) contain OUI bits[3:18]. Bits[15:0] of MII register 03h (PHYID LOW) 
contain the most significant OUI bits[19:24]: six manufacturer model number bits, and four revision number 
bits. The two least significant OUI binary bits are not used.

Broadcom Corporation's OUI is 00-10-18 (expressed as hexadecimal values). The binary OUI is 0000-0000-
0000-1000-0001-1000. The model number for the BCM50685 is 0Bh. Revision numbers start with 0h and 
increment by 1 for each chip modification.

1000Base-X Registers 00h to 14hBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Remote Fault
Setting bits[13:12] sends a remote fault indication to the link partner during auto-negotiation. Writing a 00 to 
this bit clears the Remote Fault transmission bit. This bit returns a nonzero when advertising remote fault; 
otherwise, it returns a 00.

Pause
Bits[8:7] determine the pause capability of the Switch/MAC that the BCM50685 is connected to.

Half-Duplex Capable
When bit 6 = 1, the BCM50685 advertises 1000Base-X half-duplex capability. When the bit is cleared, the 
BCM50685 advertises no 1000Base-X half-duplex capability. This bit updates during reset based on configuring 
the hardware pins in the following way: (INTF_SEL[3] AND INTF_SEL[2] AND ANEN) OR (NOT INTF_SEL[3]) OR 
(NOT INTF_SEL[2]). 

Full-Duplex Capable
When bit 5 = 1, the BCM50685 advertises 1000Base-X full-duplex capability. When this bit is cleared, the 
BCM50685 advertises no 1000Base-X full-duplex capability. This bit updates during reset based on configuring

Fiber/SerDes CRC Error
This bit indicates if a CRC error was detected at the receiver of the fiber interface in 1000Base-X or 100Base-FX 
modes (or SGMII, if in SGMII Slave mode).

100Base-FX Mode Change
This bit indicates if the 100Base-FX mode change occurred. This would occur if the PHY is switched between 
100Base-FX mode and 1000Base-X mode.

Clause 37 Auto-negotiation Page Received
This bit indicates if an auto-negotiation page has been received.

Mode Select Change
This bit indicates if mode select (register 1Ch Shadow 1Fh bits 2:1) bits change. This would occur if auto-detect 
mode is enabled and the PHY switches from fiber to copper MDI mode, or vice-versa. Also, if in 1Ch shadow 
1Eh, the auto-detect medium default (register 1Ch shadow 1Eh bit 2) is changed, this initiates a mode select 
change interrupt. 

Fiber Link Status Change
This bit indicates if there is a change in the link status for 1000Base-X, 100Base-FX or SGMII-Slave.

QSGMII RegistersBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

The QSGMII registers operate under the IEEE 802.3 Clause 22 management access protocol (See “MII 
Management Interface Register Programming” on page 81 for more details). Table 118 shows the MII 
management frame format.

The Clause 22 management protocol addressing scheme has a limitation of 32 registers for each PHY Address. 
In order to overcome this limitation, the BCM50685 registers use 2 indirect address pointers to expand its 
register addressing space. The two indirect address pointers are described below:

1. Block Address 
Register (BAR) 
pointer: The QSGMII 
registers are 
organized into 4K 
blocks of register 
space. Each block has 
sixteen registers. 
Register address of 
0x1F in each block is 
reserved for the BAR 
pointer. The BAR 
pointer determines 
which block of 
register banks are 
used for the next 
read/write operation. 
 
The MII management 
frame format for 
setting the BAR 
pointer is shown 
below:

a. ST = 01 (Clause 22 
Frame)

b. OP = 01(MII write 
operation)

c. PHYAD = 
PHYAD[4:0] pins 
+8 (This is the 
QSGMII PHY 
address. See “PHY 

Address (PHYAD)” 
on page 81 for 
more details.)

d. REGAD = 0x1F 
(Register address 
where the BAR 
pointer resides)

e. Data[15:4] = BAR 
pointer (Block 
Address to be 
accessed)

f. Data[3:0] = Don’t 
care, set these bits 
= 0x0. (The lower 4 
bits of the data 
field are not used 
for the BAR 
pointer.)

2. Address Extension 
Register (AER) 
pointer: The AER 
pointer is used to 
determine which one 
of the 2 QSGMII ports 
(QSGMII[1] and 
QSGMII[2]) or which 
one of the 8 SGMII 
lanes (SGMII Lane 1 to 
SGMII Lane 8) are to 
be accessed. SGMII 
Lane 1 corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 1, 

SGMII lane 2 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 2, 
SGMII lane 3 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 3, 
SGMII lane 4 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 4, 
SGMII lane 5 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 5, 
SGMII lane 6 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 6, 
SGMII lane 7 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 7, 
and SGMII lane 8 
corresponds to 
Copper PHY port 8. 
The AER pointer takes 
two MDIO write 
operations to set its 
value. The first write 
operation sets the 
BAR pointer with 
value of 0xFFD. After 
this write operation 
the BAR pointer is set 
to the Block where 
the AER pointer 
resides. The second 

step is to write the 
register address and 
the content value for 
the AER.  
The MII management 
frame format for 
setting the BAR 
pointer is shown 
below:

a. ST = 01 (Clause 22 
Frame)

b. OP = 01(MII write 
operation)

c. PHYAD = 
PHYAD[4:0] pins 
+8 (This is the 
QSGMII PHY 
address. See “PHY 
Address (PHYAD)” 
on page 81 for 
more details.)

d. REGAD = 0x1E 
(Register address 
where the AER 
register resides)

e. Data[15:0] = AER 
Pointer. (Specify 
which QSGMII 
port or SGMII lane 
to be accessed) 
Table 119 shows 
which QSGMII

Temp Monitor Interrupt Mask
If Bit 7 is set, interrupts from the temperature monitor sensor are masked. The status bits will still operate, but 
will not generate an interrupt output.

Voltage Monitor Mode Select
Setting bits [4:3] to 0’b11 or 0’b10 set the voltage monitor to measure both the 1.2V and 3.3V supplies. Setting 
bits [4:3] to 0’b00 sets the voltage monitor to measure the 1.2V supply only, while setting bits [4:3] to ‘0b01 
sets the voltage monitor to measure 3.3V supply only.

Note: 
• RESET must be low when power supplies are ramping up.
• When RESET is low, there must be a valid clock signal at the REFCLK input. All external power supplies need 

to be stable.
• MII register read/write access and normal PHY operation can start at the end of the RESET_WAIT tiP H�
• RESET_PU must be performed when the device is first powered up. Software reset or RESET_LEN does not 

need to be performed after RESET_PU.
• Software reset or RESET_LEN should not be performed until after RESET_PU and RESET_WAIT have been 

completed. After issuing a software reset or a RESET_LEN, normal PHY operation can begin after waiting 
the RESET_WAIT time of 20 µs.

• Software reset behaves the same as hardware reset (all hardware configuration pins are relatched).

Junction Temperature Estimation and PSIJT Versus ThetaJCBCM50685 Advance Data Sheet

Junction Temperature Estimation and PSIJT Versus ThetaJC
Package thermal characterization parameter Psi-JT (ΨJT) yields a better estimation of actual device junction 
temperature (TJ) versus using the junction-to-case thermal resistance parameter Theta-JC (θJC). The reason for 
this is, θJC assumes that all the power is dissipated through the top surface of the package case. In actual 
applications some of the power is dissipated through the bottom and sides of the package. ΨJT takes into 
account power dissipated through the top, bottom and sides of the package. The equation for calculating the 
device junction temperature is as follows: 

Where:

• TJ = junction 
temperature at 
steady-state 
condition, °C

• TT = package case top 
center temperature 
at steady-state 
condition, °C

• P = device power 
dissipation, Watts 
(4.32W for 
BCM50685)

• ΨJT = package 
thermal 
characteristics (no 
airflow), °C/W

RoHS Compliant Packaging
Broadcom offers both a standard package and a RoHS package that is in compliance with RoHS and WEEE 
directives. Standard parts are also in compliance with these directives, with the exception of Pb (>1000ppm). 
Table 177 shows the main differences between standard and RoHS compliant parts.

RoHS compliant parts have a letter 'G' added to the top line of the part marking. Standard parts (non Pb-free 
parts) are NOT compatible to Pb-free surface mount process. See application note: PACKAGINGAN101-R for
