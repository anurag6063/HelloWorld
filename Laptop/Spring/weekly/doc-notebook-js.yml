  - note: Origin of JavaScript
    comment: Self is a prototype-based dynamic object-oriented programming language, environment, and virtual machine centered around \
      the principles of simplicity, uniformity, concreteness, and liveness. \  
      JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self.
      Scheme is primarily a functional programming language. It shares many characteristics with other members of the Lisp programming
      language family. Scheme's very simple syntax is based on s-expressions, parenthesized lists in which a prefix operator is followed
      by its arguments. Scheme programs thus consist of sequences of nested lists. Lists are also the main data structure in Scheme, 
      leading to a close equivalence between source code and data formats (homoiconicity). Scheme programs can easily create and evaluate 
      pieces of Scheme code dynamically.

Notes: 
  - note: Array and Objects common
    comment: Both can hold any type of data. 

  - note: Arrays access and methods 
    comment: We have builtin functions like Push- adds element at end, Pop; removes element from end, Shift; 
      Adds at start and unshift, removes from start. Slice, to form a sub array.

  - note: Arrays InfexOf
    comment: Can be used to find index of a existing element of -1 to say its not there.

  - note: More info as screenshots in folder
    comment: on array and object and their comparison.
